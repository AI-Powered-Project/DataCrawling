	"I've been here for 10 years but my roommate has moved out. It's a really nice spot, central to East Bay and city stuff. There's a free shuttle bus stop across the street that goes to through Emeryville past IKEA and Pixar to MacArthur BART. The peninsula is great; it's nice and calm out here - the apartment complex is next to a little market and the police and fire stations.\n\nWe'd like to find a roommate that could move in for a month to month or 6 month time period, perhaps more if it is mutually agreeable. There also is a covered parking spot in the garage that you could use if you would like to. Rent includes utilities & internet (fiber). Deposit would be a half month's rent.\n\n\nMy partner and I share the master bedroom. You'd be moving into the 9’ 6” x 14’ 6” bedroom, with your own bathroom and shower. The window looks south onto the East Bay. The bedroom has a small desk, lamps, and memory foam mattresses if you’d like. You’d also have a large hall closet to store/hang things.\n\nThe complex has 4 pools (one is heated and one salt water), 2 jacuzzis (one indoor, one outdoor), a sauna room, tennis courts, racquetball courts, and a workout room with weight machines.\n\nI'm a teacher in SFUSD, so I'm gone M-F from about 7:00AM - 6 PM. We're quiet and tidy and have a friendly cat. When home we enjoy cooking and reading, listening to records, walking around the peninsula and sometimes taking advantage of the apt facilities.\n\n\nWho are you? Where do you work?\n    ",

My dog is an adorable freeloader :)\n\nLocation:\nIn the complex, there is a community pool, large lawn area with picnic benches, and lots of lush greenery with pedestrian access with walking paths to parks nearby. It’s conveniently located between the 280 and 101 freeway. There are several supermarkets close by – Safeway, Trader Joes, Whole Foods, and Bargain Outlet are just within a mile’s distance. We’re just a couple miles from downtown Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Los Altos which are great dining options. \n\nRoom Description:\nThe available room is a single occupancy room on the first floor. It comes unfurnished with a large private bathroom and a private entryway access to the front patio. You have the option of converting the lock, so it’s a closed-off unit, or keeping the lock as is, so it's a room with regular access to the rest of the home. The available first floor room comes with a private fridge, microwave, and mini-laundry unit. \n\nRest of the Unit:\nYou are welcome to use the upstairs laundry unit as well, but the mini laundry unit is great for personal use. The second floor bedroom will remain empty and may be converted into my office space in the near future. The house has central A/C. The shared space on the second floor includes the living room with TV and kitchen with dining table. \n\nLease Terms:\nMonthly rent is $1800 per month plus utilities which include water, electricity, gas, internet and comes out to an estimated $120 dollars a month. Minimum 12 month lease and month-to-month thereafter. Deposit is one month's rent and will be returned net of cleaning fees and damages upon departure. Room is currently available.\n\nAdditional Considerations:\nNo additional pets, no loud noise, smoking permitted outside. \nStreet parking within the complex available.\nWill require credit check and renter’s insurance. \n\n",

	"Roommate wanted for shared home in Petaluma:  Looking for 1 housemate to join a friendly shared (between 3 persons including you) 2200 sq foot/4 bedroom house in Petaluma, starting after July 9th,  2023.  Your room ($1250 per month): 144 sq foot, unfurnished, with 2 windows, western facing so lots of light. You share a bathroom with 1 other (amazing:) female identifying person.  The interior common areas are mostly furnished (but if you have items of your own, we can discuss how to include:) and consist of a “great” room (living, dining, kitchen area with refrigerator) and a separate pantry with a second refrigerator, sink, washer,and dryer. We have lots of outdoor space and are just starting to develop the garden/landscaping so welcome anyone who likes to get their hands in the dirt and grow things:). There is a separate front yard with two chaise lounge chairs as well a main outdoor BBQ area with patio table & chairs flanked by another lounge area all located right off the great room/main entrance.  The house is located on a few acre farm so there is off-street parking within the gate that surrounds the entire property.  A very social (and cool) indoor/outdoor cat named Griff lives with us but tends to enter/exit and sleep in my room.  Unfortunately the landlord does not want any other pets at this time. On a day-to-day basis we all do our own things, and are independent, but we do have a communal consciousness to how we care for our home so we want someone who wants to live like that as well.  We care about finding the best ways to co-exist together and in general are pretty organic but still intentional about things.  We are positive, assume the best, consider others, communicate simply as we go along, and talk about things as needed so good “people” skills are valued and important to us.  There are a few other dwellings on the property and we have good relationships with the folks that live there. We tend to gather with them (and other friends who we each want to invite) for “family” style dinners here and there (every few weeks) and also host small house parties/outdoor gatherings a handful of times a year. Sometimes we have had group “game” or movie nights. No smoking indoors, nor cigarette butts in yard outdoors please. Must be 420 & (moderate consumption:) alcohol friendly. Would be ideal if you work outside the home, especially in the afternoons/evenings, in order to stagger all of our work schedules and optimize private time in common spaces as well.  That being said we sometimes cook, watch something, or hang out together as it feels right too.  Rent includes utilities (water, gas, trash, inet).  Also is $100 per person per month for electricity (an estimate based on past usage averaged over the entire year for heat) but if our bill exceeds that allotment due to high usage we contribute the difference split between us three ways. Month-to-month lease, but preference is for longer leases (if all is going well and everyone is happy) or if not we are open to you moving on to something that might work better for you. 1 month security deposit/30 days notice. DM me for a phone call to learn more and see if we might be a good fit for each other. Note:  I am currently traveling, but can show the space and meet starting July 8th:)\n",

	"Hi potential housemate *waves*! Thanks for stopping by to read my ad - if you like what you see don't hesitate to email to learn more.\n\n**About theApartment**:\n- 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment. The total rent is currently $2,405, and we split it evenly $1262.50 each. You get the bigger room and bigger closet with (partial) ocean view, and I get the assigned parking space. This is a great deal, since people moving into the same complex now pay over $3200/ month for the same size apartment we have. Why yes, I have lived here since the dawn of time; why do you ask?\n- Your room has a huge window facing west (the ocean! sunsets!), and one whole wall is a mirrored closet. So there's a *ton* of closet space, plus bathroom and kitchen space.\n- Apartment is fully furnished (except your room). This would be a great place for someone who wants to live in a nicely decorated place but doesn't want to do any of the decorating work themselves.\n- No pets :(\n-also in the complex, and available for use anytime: swimming pool, fitness center, sauna, and \"business center\" (i.e. the main office will fax/copy things for you)\n\n**About the Neighborhood**:\n- Pacifica Manor district, beachside\nWithin 2-3 blocks or less you can reach: Safeway, Walgreens, post office, gourmet deli, butchers, sushi, two pizza/ Italian restaurants, three taquerias, a non-Starbucks coffee hangout (plus two actual Starbucks), authentic English fish 'n chips, two bakeries (one that makes amazing bread and the other amazing desserts), a Chinese restaurant, two hot pot restaurants, Middle Eastern restaurant, chicken 'n waffle (cone) spot, soon to open ice cream parlor (Booza style!!), McDonalds, a gas station with honest mechanics, another gas station, 24 hour fitness gym, hot yoga, a place where you can learn to scuba dive and/or swim, and probably a ton more stuff that I'm forgetting. We have a walkability score of 74, which is pretty great for the 'burbs. Also lots of amazing hiking in the area and a spot to parasail within walking distance if you're into that!\n- The ocean is less than half a block from the apartment. The sound of surf will lull you to sleep. Really, this area is fantastic. And it's really close to the city...\n- 15-20 minutes door to door for most SF locations (without traffic). It takes less time to get from the mission to our place than from the Mission to outer sunset or the marina.\n\n**About Me (Your New Roommate)**:\nfemale, adult (mumbles age)\nnon-smoker/ drinker\n- neat/ clean/quiet/ contentious roommate - personality wise I'm outgoing and friendly\n- artsy and interesting, with a solid sense of humor. I like exploring, traveling, theater, improv, karaoke, painting, arting (it's a word!), hanging out with friends, and learning new things.\n- occasionally watches TV online (e.g. no cable); seem to attract friends that don't.\n- value kindness and consideration for other people, regardless of gender, race, orientation, etc. I *strongly* believe that the key to good roommate relations is respect, consideration, empathy, and good conflict resolution skills.\n\n**About You**:\n-roughly late 20's-40's\n-no smoking (including cannabis, though edibles=OK), heavy drinking, or heavy drugs\n-clean, kind, contentious, and quiet (no midnight bongo drum sessions).\n-considerate and respectful in all things, and just a generally Good Person\n-No couples :(. While the room itself is a good size, there is only one bathroom, and that can get crowded quickly with three full time people.\n\nCOVID STUFF:\nI'm fully vaccinated and mostly work from home. I'm also immunocompromised, so I mask in public and generally do my best to avoid COVID, because there's more chance it would be serious or lead to long COVID for me.\n\n**Fine Print**:\n-Utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, wifi, and household/cleaning supplies) generally run $100-120 each per month.\n-Willing to make a 1 year commitment.\n- Room is available now. Security deposit is $700.\n\nCool? Great. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more about me (your host, AJ) or the apartment, shoot me an email. To avoid spammers/ people who aren't reading this, please include your favorite ice cream flavor. Re: spammers - this has gotten much worse and it seems all want is my phone number. For this reason first contact will be via zoom, and we can call/ schedule in person visit from there.\n",

	"Hi! I am a 37 y/o cishet white woman originally from Seattle, WA, I have lived in the Bay Area for 17 years. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice, and a minor in Art.  I am passionate about environmental justice, food sovereignty, and the intersection of art and activism. I am committed to doing my part in the fight for liberation and dismantling systems of oppression. I currently work full-time at a grocery store in San Francisco. Some of my interests include making art (such as drawing, painting, and screen printing), music, tarot reading, horror movies, cooking vegetarian & vegan food (I am vegetarian but am okay with meat being cooked around me), taking care of my indoor plant babies, and I am enthusiastic about learning more about gardening and growing food. \n\nI would love to find a home that feels safe, solid, and cozy. I have had many years of experience living in shared houses. I am very mindful, accepting, and respectful of all identities. I care greatly about creating a home where everyone feels safe and accepted. I value open, honest, trauma-informed communication. I am always open to talk about any conflict or issue that may arise, even when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. I am very conscious of how I impact and live in shared spaces. I am dedicated to reflecting on my own privilege, and I am continually learning how to be a better accomplice against oppression. \n\nI am very kind, empathetic, and supportive. I am an introvert who loves human connection and also needs a good amount of alone time to recharge. I enjoy spending time with my roommates and creating community in the house and am also considerate of my roommates' own space and time and respect their boundaries. I am respectful of the common spaces in the house and am good at keeping these clean. I am also not a neat-freak and understand if there is a little mess, as life and busy schedules can sometimes get in the way. I occasionally have a friend or two over, and have a couple drinks now and then, but I don't bring the party home. I am also 420-friendly. I do not have any pets of my own, but I love animals and am comfortable living in a household with fur babies. \n\nI am looking for a private, unfurnished room in the San Francisco Bay Area (preferably SF, Daly City, Oakland, or Berkeley) with women or nonbinary roommates. My budget is around $1300/month. My preferred move-in date is end of July. \n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your household, I would love to hear from you! Take care and best of luck in your housemate search!\n\nBest,\nM\n",

	"Hello, my name is Kevin. I am 46 years old and I am looking for a room, mobile home or studio to rent in the Santa Cruz area. I am very quiet, considerate and keep to myself. I would prefer an older roommate or roommates who are as mature and considerate as I am. Perhaps a single home owner that has a room available because of divorce or empty nest. The only thing I truly wish is to have the possible future option of getting 1 Teacup Chihuahua. No drugs, no drinks, no smoking. I am way over the partying years. I just want somewhere I can come home and be at peace. I lead a simple life and have very little material possessions or baggage. I have held the same job for the past 12 years and I also drive for Door Dash to get ahead, so money saved. No problem signing a year lease if it is a good fit. My monthly rent budget is no more than $1,200 based on my annual income. I'm pretty much alone in the world, so sharing housing is my only option even though I make what would be considered adequate in most cities.

	"The Inner Sunset… You know it, you love it. It’s got tons of great restaurants and shops, it’s right next to Golden Gate Park, right down the hill from UCSF, and the weather is a perfect mix of sunny and overcast. We have a room open in our three-bedroom, 1.5 bath apartment, with a great living room, a full kitchen, and a beautiful sunny (when sunny) garden out back. The N Judah stops on our corner. Our apartment is great, and we’re looking to complete it with someone who will mesh well with us and our lifestyles.\n\nThere are two of us living here currently. We’re two dudes in our early forties who have been friends for many years. One of us is a teacher, and the other is a stagehand, so we can have wildly different schedules, but still manage to sometimes cook together and hang out around the house. It’s a pretty social environment. We have a bunch of cool friends who visit us occasionally, and sometimes we’ll have a movie night or a small party. We’re 420-friendly and half queer, and are looking for a housemate who naturally fits.\n\nYou should be chill, down to earth, and be on top of your shit financially and easy to live with. Ideally you have your own friends who will be friendly and compatible with ours. We pitch in on chores together, and don’t really have a schedule or a rotation. We drink occasionally, usually just a beer or glass of wine with dinner. You should be similar, and not drink to excess regularly. \n\nThe room is 10’x13’, with a small closet. Its windows open onto a sky well which gets indirect light and is perfect for a little window garden. The living room is cozy, with some comfy couches, a dry bar, dining area, 5.1 surround, a turntable, and cool lighting. We have central heating, robust wi-fi and Xfinity's fastest residential internet. We split Comcast and PG&E three ways, which usually comes out to about $100-$130 per person depending on the time of year. The kitchen is well stocked and full of all the gadgets, including a dishwasher. We have a washer and dryer in the unit, and a fire pit in the garden.  We love animals, (one of us is Team Cat, one of us loves both!) but cannot accommodate pets at this time.\n\nGet in touch if it seems like a good fit. Please tell us a bit about yourself, your schedule, hobbies, and what you’re like around the house.  Not including this in your email may result in no reply! \n\nWe’d like to meet people soon, but our schedules are kind of busy. We can meet people over the weekend, or evenings during the week. Please let us know when would work for you. We look forward to meeting you!\n\n\n",

	"Greetings!\n\n2 rooms in our 3-bedroom household will be available starting today, July 1, 2023.  The monthly cost is $1100 + $200 flat fee for utilities.  $1300 total per room.  While we charge a flat fee for utilities, we still ask that occupants be mindful about water and electricity usage.  \n\nThe rooms are both about 13'x12' , have  huge, Eastern-facing windows, hardwood floors,  good-sized closets, and great views of our large backyard - complete with professionally manicured garden. We're located near the intersection of Ortega and 29th Ave. \n\nAmenities include (but aren't limited to):\n-Washer and dryer in the garage\n-Large kitchen\n-Spacious living room we've converted into a yoga/workout space\n-Tons of light(skylights/windows, everywhere)\n-Easy street parking\n\nThe house is conveniently located near restaurants and bars. Safeway supermarket is only a block away. Easy access to City College, San Francisco State schools, shopping, and public transportation. 5 Blocks to the L on Taraval and N on Judah. 1 block to the 48 and the 7  muni lines\n\nAbout Us (both he, his, him):\n\nBrandon and Angel: 38 + 36,  Occupy the downstairs area. Own and operate a small horticultural design business.  We work long hours and have little time for idle socializing.  So if you feel the need to feel like a close-knit family with your roommates, this may not be the right situation for you.  We do a lot of cooking mornings and evening.   We like to play music (always open to wearing headphones for folks with conflicting sleep schedules) and start most days with yoga in the living room.  \n\nWe're a colorful, vibrant, outspoken, active, open-minded, queer/diversity-friendly, and 420-friendly household with an emphasis on sustainable living practices (collecting grey water, cloth towels rather than paper towels, biodegradable unscented detergents, soaps, etc). \n\nOur household is free of strong, artificial fragrances.   So folks who use strong perfumes, air fresheners, colognes, deodorants, etc. would need to make a life adjustment or kindly look elsewhere for lodging. \n\nWe're looking for an independent, mature, clean, professional, respectful individual who is capable of being proactive and dispassionate in communication with their roommates when/if issues arise.  Our ideal roommate has a life outside of the house and has interests and goals that they pursue.  \n\nWe don't currently have a chore system and do not have time to create or manage one.  So the ideal candidate has enough of an appreciation/respect for their living spaces that they regularly take for small cleaning projects AND/OR has a mind for management and can help to create an equitable cleaning system.\n\nDisqualifying factors:\n-Pets (negotiable)\n-Loud parties\n-Frequent overnight guests\n-People with sensitive ears / light sleepers\n-Cigarette smoking\n-Work from home\n-School from home\n-Religious fervor \n-Frequent/elaborate kitchen use\n\nOne room is currently available, the other will be available mid-July  \nMove-in cost = 1st month (1300) + deposit (1300) = 2600 per room\n\nIf you're interested, please respond with some information about yourself. \n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

	"Hi, we have a room available at our place in the Dogpatch. The room is large, sunny, and has sliding doors to our deck. The bathroom is shared, but with only one roomate. \n\nThe aparment has three bedrooms, two full baths, and is on the top floor with a full private deck. The living room and kitchen are furnished, but we also have some room for you to add things if you'd like. We are litterally two blocks from the 22nd St. Caltrain station, one block from the Muni, and four blocks from the I-280 ramp. \n\nWe're looking for a clean and respectful roommate, with similar schedules. We're two professionals in our late 30's. A European tech sociologist & cook extraordinaire, and a genome biologist & ocean lover (surfing, free diving, kiting). We like grabbing a drink or a bite once in a while, but also have pretty tight schedules, so we really like to keep things relaxed and pretty low key at home during the week. \n\nThe neighborhood, the Dogpatch, it's amazing. Almost always sunny and 10 degrees warmer than the rest of SF. Workshops, brunch, galleries, gourmet ice cream, breweries, amazing restaurants, rock climbing, and literally less than 10 minutes from the 22nd St. Caltrain Station, Muni, and I-280 access. It is also in a flat part of town so it's also perfect for biking to a lot of places.\n\nThe rent for the room is $1,650 per month + 1/3 utilities. The sublet is month to month, with 45 days notice, and a 2 month deposit. Ideally we are looking for someone that is aiming to stay for the longer term, eg more than six months, but we may consider shorter terms. \n\nTo come see it, please tell us a little bit about yourself and what you are doing in SF. If you can share a linkedin or social profile to help show you are a working human able to pay rent, that would really help. We'll then get back to you and figure out a time for you to come see it.

	"Hi there, my name is Moe and I'm subletting my room for about a year, from Oct 1 2023 to July 1st, 2024.\n\nOriginal rent is $1133/mo, discounted rate is $1000/mo for the care of my cat, Panna Cotta!\n\nAbout the house: We are 3 white queers (K and A are my roommates), two of us are trans, including me! We're in the upper unit of a duplex on a side street thats relatively quiet with easy street parking. We have a huge private backyard with 3 garden beds that's perfect for gardening, parties, and laying about in the hammock! In-unit w/d, dishwasher, garbage disposal. We have 1 parking space which you can snag if the other K and A haven't already. There are stairs up to the front door and down to the backyard. We're 420 friendly but no cigarettes. Sorry, no couples or more pets!\n\nMy cat: He's a large (over 18 lbs) long-hair Maine Coon (at least that's what I think, he was rescued and I never DNA tested him) named Panna Cotta! He's a very sweet boy that enjoys being in the same room as people, and it incredibly low maintenance. He doesn't have any medications, illnesses, etc that could potentially flare up. The most he needs is kinda pricey vet food since he got surgery on his bladder a few years ago. He will let you know when he wants cuddles, and when he wants you to stop. Doesn't knock things off shelves which is nice! Overall a very chill cat. His litter box is inside my room and due to the lack of floor space in the rest of the apartment, it cannot be moved elsewhere. I have a litter genie which is INCREDIBLE at keeping things smelling like nothing and a great tool to have.\n\nAbout the room: Fully Furnished! Full-sized bed with storage drawers underneath. Medium sized and bright! Includes a small closet, and the connected bathroom is shared jack-and-jill style with my roommate A. We both have similar standards when it comes to bathroom cleanliness and it is routinely cleaned and maintained by the both of us.\n\nWhat we're looking for: We want to keep this a queer home, and prioritize BIPOC folks! A and K would like to be a part of the process, since obviously they would be sharing the home with someone new, and in A's case the shared bathroom. We would like someone who enjoys to be socially engaged to an extent, because we like to host events at our home, including craft and game nights, as well as larger parties in the backyard. You don't have to be a mega extrovert of course, but because our home is a small hub for queer community, we would like someone to be open to participate somewhat in the planning of things! :) Just someone who is clean, friendly, and obviously a cat person and will take good care of my furbaby while I'll away getting my masters!\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!! Thank you so much!\n",

	"Hello, \n\nI am looking for a new living arrangement. I am interested in having a like-minded roommate or roommates. SF is preferred, but I am open to considering other locations. After searching CL for housing and not really finding the ideal situation, I have decided to post an ad on CL in the hopes of seeing what's out there. \n\nAbout me: I am an associate professor at San Francisco State University. I am 40 years old and have lived in the Bay Area for the past 7 years. Currently, I live near SFSU campus, where I have resided on and off for about 6 years now. I have a month-to-month lease, so I can move whenever.  I have no pets. In terms of my schedule, I am typically at work on campus 2-3 days/week during the semester. I like to get out of town and go on road trips on the weekends, but also explore all that the Bay Area has to offer. \n\nAnyway, I am putting the feelers out to see what type of opportunity presents itself for a new cool place to call home. \n\nBest wishes, \nIan\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/iandunham/\n\n",

There is in-unit washer and dryer and plenty of storage space in the garage if needed as well as full access to the kitchen, dining room and living room.  I've already been approved but the management company said they'd prefer I already start the lease with a roommate instead of adding one later. I need this to be a quick turnaround so the quicker you can tour it and send in materials, the better! About the place... It's a 3 bedroom apartment on the 4th floor of a walk up building. I'd much prefer to just have 1 roommate and have us share the 3rd bedroom as a small office when we're working from home. If there's space, maybe throw a couch in there and have it be a guest bedroom. The bedrooms aren't the biggest so having the 3rd room as a bonus one would be great. No washer/dryer in the building but there's central air. I also loved the rooftop when I toured it.

	"Greetings, \n\nOne spacious private room, fully furnished, with private balcony, shared bathroom with 1 individual. \n\nLittle info about us:\nWe are 2 working individuals in our 30s who have been living together for few years now, looking for a 3rd roommate around our age. While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways:  580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for. Feel free to ask any questions you might have :)\n\n\nTo move in: 1st month rent + last month rent + $1100 security deposit.\nLooking for someone for a LONG TERM, minimum a year stay. \nRent is $1100 + utilities (generally around $50).\n\nThank you and looking forward to hearing from you :)\n",

PGE has ranged from $60-180 per person per month in the last year. Landlord pays for water and garbage. Coin laundry in building. No Section 8’s, according to landlord.\n\nGood for a someone who has furniture (but not a requirement) as there currently isn’t any in the kitchen or living room.

Only available to show in the mornings. \n\nYou’ll also get your own parking spot in the carport if you have a car since I don’t drive. Apartment also has a porch. Pets allowed with landlord’s prior consent. Strongly prefer a female roommate who works the evening/night shift, since I will soon be doing that so having that in common would be perfect. Current employment is required.\n\nWe’ll meet in-person first where you can see the apartment, then if you like it and we’re a good match, I’ll let the landlord know. He then needs an application and in-person interview.\n\nEmail only—I reply within 3 hours during the day. If this ad is still up, the room is available.\n",

We are pretty active, sometimes rambunctious household during the day, and at night quiet and asleep.  The kids have very limited amount of screen time, so they are pretty active in the house.  We are all social and outgoing, and accustomed to living with a roommate.  Our current roommate has lived with us for about 3 years and is moving out to relocate out of state. I currently work primarily from home (remotely) and only go into the office occasionally.\n\nWe have both front and back yard, with fire pit.  the square footage of the house is 1350, I don't know the square footage of the room, but its sizeable.  \n\nParking is street parking only. no off street parking available, but 95% of the time there's spots available in front of the house.\n\nAll utilities (including wifi) are included with rent. \n\nwasher/dryer.\n\nMove in costs: first & last month, plus security deposit of $500\n\nThe room is available now, and can be pro rated depending on when you move in.

	"Seeking a Great Roommate\n\nBig lovely room available in shared household on August 21st/22nd! \nI’m seeking someone who is a good communicator, willing to share in household chores, and likes a balance of doing our own thing and being friendly when we’re both around. \n\nThe place: \nThe apartment is a cozy, sweet 2-bedroom corner unit on the second floor (one flight of stairs to reach) in Duboce Triangle - one block from beautiful Duboce park. The available bedroom is large - 12 x 15, and has a bay window, some built-in shelving, and a good sized closet, located outside the room in the hallway. Bedroom is currently lightly furnished with a bed, lamp and nightstand, but if you want to bring your own furniture, I can empty the room. The apartment has a sunny, stocked kitchen and a cozy furnished living room. Kitchen has a gas stove, fridge, microwave, toaster, but alas, no dishwasher. The split bathroom has a tub for soaking. Laundry is located downstairs in the building and takes credit cards.\n\nAbout the Area:\nEvery time I tell someone I live in Duboce Triangle, they light up and say “I LOVE Duboce Triangle!!” It’s easy to love it here - quaint, peaceful tree-lined streets all around, and a beautiful nearby park to catch the abundant sunshine. Both the N Judah and the Church st MUNI station are short blocks away, and you can walk to the 16th st BART in 15 minutes. The Castro, the Mission, and the Lower Haight are all right here, and there are tons of cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby. It’s in the geographic center of the city, so you can get most places pretty quickly from here. If you have a car, you can get a parking permit for the area, and street parking is relatively easy - I usually find a spot fairly quickly, and rarely need to park more than a couple of blocks away.\n\nSome things to consider: \nApartment currently has no pets, but I’m open to a well-behaved, mostly quiet dog. (Sorry, no cats, I’m allergic). No smoking of any kind in the house (this is not a 420 friendly household per my allergies/sensitivities). The house is scent-free. Please no perfume, incense, scented candles. The space is only big enough for one additional person (sorry, no couples). There’s no TV in the living room. \n\nAbout the Rent and Move In costs:\n$1695/month includes utilities and internet. Move in costs will be the first month’s rent, plus a deposit equal to one month’s rent, for a total of $3,390. \nYour lease agreement will be month to month, one year minimum stay preferred. \n\nAbout me: \nI’m a woman, originally from the East Coast - responsible, friendly, direct, a good communicator, and easy to get along with. I lead a pretty busy life, but often like to just relax at home too. Working full time and also currently in school for a Master’s degree. I prefer a pretty quiet house, so I’m able to study/work from home.\n\nAbout my potential roommate:\n-Easygoing, responsible, fun, fairly chill/quiet lifestyle\n-Non-smoking, non-fragrance or incense using\n-Sober or light drinkers okay but no heavy drinkers, drug use/partiers\n-Prefers a clean/tidy household and able to do house chores and pay rent without being reminded\n-Preferably someone with minimal stuff (apartment is totally furnished and there’s not much in the way of storage space outside of the room/closet). There is space in the apartment for a bicycle, if you have one.\n\nIf you’re interested and think you might be a match, please do get in touch and tell me about yourself! \nThanks - and I look forward to hearing from you!!\n    ",

We’re all focused on work and mostly keep to ourselves and our own business. We’re all friendly and considerate and respectful towards each other’s person and property. We range in age from a mature early 20’s, to a youthful early 50’s, men and women. We decided our preference is to have a few more people around to save money. It works well for us because we are all good, likable, agreeable and BUSY! We live with more gratitude than attitude. 🙏😌We are aware of much of the tension and chaos locally and in the world, but try to be positive and proactive and to leave the drama outside our door. Home is our sanctuary 😌🙏!\n\nWe have a very large 3 bedroom 2 bath on the second story. The space for rent is in the “dining” area of the kitchen. There’s a closet with a door that, when open, can close off the space for privacy.  There are also blackout curtains. We’ve had several roommates that have all enjoyed the space and stayed for several months to a few years. If you’re generally easy going and a fairly deep sleeper, you’ll probably like it just fine. It’s nothing fancy, just keeping things simple. There’s a fan, a little 32” tv w Xfinity and streaming capability from several apps. Little bookshelf and bedside light.  It’s furnished with a twin mattress but you’re welcome to bring your own twin or full if you prefer.\n\nIn our living room we are blessed and spoiled to have an EPIC 120” home theater with 5 channel surround sound (including a subwoofer for each channel! 🤪💥🤯)\nIt’s pretty fun just having a movie night.\n\nWe’re a short walk to the bay marina area and park. Great park. Golf course and driving range. Dog park nearby too. As is the San Leandro shooting range and Oakland Airport. \nKaiser hospital right up the street.\n\nOur area is usually pretty safe and sane.

Parking is on the street (room for one vehicle), a decent size yard, and a high-speed wifi connection.\n\nWe’ve been burned by roommates who abused the overnight guest privileges, so no overnight guests to start (that could change if we meet your significant other and get the right vibe).\n\nThis is a month-to-month rental with a signed agreement and 30-day notice to leave. Move-in costs is $2400 (first months rent plus a $1200 security deposit).\n\nIf interested, please send an email with your phone number and some basic info: work schedule/occupation, interests/activities, personality type, etc.\n",
	"I'm moving out of my apartment later this year and am looking for someone to take over my bedroom and lease from mid-September (start date negotiable) through the end of 2023. It's a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment, so you'd have your own bathroom to yourself.\n\nRent is ~$2,000 per month when accounting for all utilities, water, Wi-Fi, etc. Parking is available in building for an additional $250/mo. There's laundry in building and also a Fitness SF attached to the tower. The larger complex also has a small grass area and a dog park! (Building is pet friendly)\n\nThe roommate is generally pretty quiet and clean, and is usually out of the apartment most weekends. I knew him through mutual friends in college and there's never been any issues.\n\nThe apartment is located in Lower Pac Heights, so it's very easy to get to anywhere in the city. It's particularly close to Japantown, Mission and Pac Heights areas but plenty of busses nearby for other transport. It also has amazing views looking north from the bedroom towards Pac Heights and east from the living room to downtown.\n\nPlease see below for pictures, and comment/msg me for more details!\n    ",

	"Room rent is $1100, partial work exchange possible, plus shared utilities (currently about $125 per person all utilities included).  We're located in a quiet and safe area of Maxwell Park in Oakland, less than half a mile from Mills/NU.  Move-in requires first and last month rent, plus $1,100 security deposit. \n\nMy housemate is moving out and I’m looking to fill her room. I'm a responsible, mature female and I work as an environmental consultant.  \nI love animals, going out dancing, seeing live concerts/shows, and exploring mama nature. I'm the type of person that can find beauty in the little things, and I consider myself to be a free-spirited individual. I like to keep a clean home, the type of space where I can walk around barefoot, and just kickback and relax at the end of the day. I usually like to keep to myself, but I'm always down to talk or hang out if you want company. I scored as an \"ISFP\" on the personality score, if you're curious lol. I'm pretty chill overall, understanding, and easy to live with as long as we maintain boundaries and responsibilities. I work out of the home some of the week so I may not be around that much, and I often go out when I want to socialize. However, company is always welcome, and I don't mind overnight guests as long as you're respectful of the home, and mindful of my schedule. The other roommate is a cat, interested in sleep and meditation, food and play! I occasionally like to have my homies over for dinner, movie/game nights, and drinks. You're always welcome to join or invite friends.\n\nThe room itself is pleasant, currently furnished but can be fully or partially unfurnished.  12’ x 11’ not counting a small walk-in closet (4 ½’ x 3’ 10”). With 2 East-facing windows, it is well insulated (fiberglass and recycled jeans insulation in walls and ceiling), was updated with dimmable LED lighting, 2 USB ports for direct charging, new high efficiency baseboard heater, and is cable-ready.  To give you an idea, the bed shown in the pics is a full-size.\n\nThe house has hardwood floors throughout, new appliances, a deck, excellent natural light.  Lots of plants, room for yours as well. \nThe bathroom is super fun -- radiant floor heat, excellent light with solar-operated skylight (more interesting plants), instant and unlimited hot water (Groher) which flows to the backyard through grey water lines.\n\nRoom is available to a pleasant, mature individual, preferably female (civilized males considered, please see form), financially secure, open in their communication style and friendly with their housemate, respectful of common areas.\nMust like cats, and you can’t have a dog because my previously mentioned 9-year old tabby is terribly afraid of dogs. I don't mind small pets like reptiles or other small creatures, just let me know about them in advance.\n\nI go away a few months per year, and if you’re interested I can lower the rent to $700 per month if/when you take care of my cat when I’m not home. Not a deal breaker - if you’d rather not get involved with her care I can make other arrangements.\n\nSounds good? Would you like to introduce yourself?  Please fill out the attached form. \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-CKTu3-5UT7XqjMizK4k1upLIjmSHcnc3WRWQIVnfVg/edit\nIf we think we may be a match, let’s do a quick Zoom and I can have you over.\n    ",

	"We have a private room available for the perfect female flatmate.\n\nThe room is pretty big (about 15'x13'), has a nicely-sized closet, and is very quiet. It's unfurnished, but the rest of the house is completely furnished. We have a backyard garden and on-site laundry, but no parking. But if you have a car, you'll be happy to learn there is always plenty of street parking in the area (honestly! it's weird).\n\nYour prospective flatmates are a married couple (hetero), who maintain two households. Mrs. Flatmate works in the East Bay and stays there M-Th, spending weekends SF. Mr. Flatmate stays in SF full time, holding down the fort. It may seem like an odd arrangement, but it works for us, and we've had housemates for many years, so this isn't a new experiment we're just trying out.\n\nWe also have a friendly cat in the house, so if you're allergic or just averse, it's not the right fit. In fact, you should probably be at least slightly positive on cats rather than neutral or \"willing to tolerate if they stay away from me\" (because she probably won't). No additional pets are allowed by lease with the property owner, so fellow pet parents are not an option.\n\nRent is a $1450/month, which includes all utilities, internet, and a housekeeper who comes every other week. We'll need one month's security deposit in addition to the first month's rent, so the move-in cost is $2900. There's no lease term, but we prefer someone who is looking for a long-term situation. Ours is a very stable home, with only a couple roommate changes over the past six or seven years. People tend to stick around (because it's affordable and a great place to live!), and that's our preference too. We're definitely looking for someone who wants a place to call home for a while rather than a person who just wants somewhere to crash for a few months.\n",
	"My husband and I (31f, 27m) are looking for a roommate in our Fulton home.  All utilities and internet are included in the rent.\n\nTHE ROOM\nThe bedroom has a private entrance and it’s own parking spot. It’s connected to our garage so you have your own separate area but are welcome in the house. You’ll have a bathroom that is mostly private but sometimes our guests use it. The bedroom is large (12x20ish) and has a door to our backyard as well. You are welcome to paint it or customize it how you wish. There’s plenty of parking for guests if you have any \n\nTHE HOUSE\nOur house is in the country on a busy road. It’s near the freeway and right on the cusp of Santa Rosa. We have 1/2 an acre with chickens, ducks, a garden, 2 dogs and a cat. We also have a really cool backyard bar that you can use. We have a kitchen with all the cooking tools and spices you would need, a washer and dryer, lots of freezer space, and a second fridge at our bar outside should you ever need extra room. We have a woodstove inside as well as a nice living room and dining room area. There’s plenty of storage space in our garage should you need. There’s AC in the house but not in the bedroom you’d be renting though I’m happy to install a unit when summer comes around. \n\nABOUT US \nMy husband and I own the house. We have had roommates for many years and they usually end up being some of our best friends. We are very easy to get along with and are respectful to live with. Last year we decided to renovate the bathroom which is why we are roommate free right now. 😁 I work Mon-Fri 8am-4:30p and my husband works Sun-Wed 6am-6pm. We both love to hike, play video games, watch tv, and hang out with friends. We are friendly and are happy with roommates who want to hang out or ones that prefer to keep to themselves. I am an outgoing, active person and my husband is more shy and quiet. We are a 420 friendly household though cigarettes are not allowed to be smoked in the house (but you’re welcome to go to the bar or anywhere outside)\n\nIDEAL ROOMMATE\nWe are happy living with people who want to hang out with us or with someone who prefers to keep to themselves.  Cats are okay to bring but no dogs please. If you like gardening I’m happy to give you a spot for plants. There’s no expectation you help with yard work or anything. We keep pretty clean and while sometimes we might make a mess it is always cleaned up by the next day at the latest. We would like the same with our potential roommate. I cook a lot so someone who was in the kitchen less would be great but I’m happy to share the space!\n",
	"Hello! I have a room for rent in a 3 story townhouse in Cotati right at the train station available right now!\n\nAbout the room: The room is located on the second floor and shares a bathroom with only one other roommate. This area of the house is sectioned off from the main living area so it stays very quiet unless you like to keep the door to your entryway open. the roommate you will be next to is a very nice young man.  He is a very quiet guy and keeps to himself.  The room is unfurnished and will have new carpet.\n\nAbout the house: The house is a 3 story townhouse with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. On the bottom floor is the 2 car garage (we use this for a pool table and game room) as well as a bedroom and bathroom. On the second floor is the kitchen, living room two bedrooms and a bathroom (this is where your room is). On the third floor is the master suite. The kitchen comes with all appliances and accessories you could possibly need and you will have your own separate cabinet for food storage. A new washer and fairly new dryer are located inside the house. The house stays pretty clean and is hardwood floor in all common areas and carpet in the bedrooms. The house is furnished tastefully except for the bedrooms which are unfurnished.\nThere is plenty of parking on the street and if you have an electric car you can charge at the train station. It is an easy walk to Oliver's, Starbucks and Energy Fitness (8 mins max) and a nice walk from SSU (25 mins for me to get to my classroom and I move very slowly).\n\nAbout the roommates:\nBOTTOM FLOOR- This room is taken by my younger brother (26). He works full time at home and stays in his room a majority of the time. He is very respectful and enjoys being on his own or hanging out with others. He has 2 cats who you would absolutely never even know lived in the house. \n\nMIDDLE FLOOR- The room is available on this level. This is the room with a shared bathroom with another tenant who is a young male (mid 20s).  He is very quiet and, like all the others, stays in his room most of the time.\n\nTOP FLOOR- This room is taken by a 27 year old male who is very sweet, quiet and is used to living with many other people.  He also has one cat (Spooky).  You will likely not see Spooky much, he likes to stay in his room.\n\nFor the most part everyone in the house keeps to themselves in their rooms but the living room is furnished and available for anyone to use.\n\nGas, water and garbage are included in rent (all utilities).\n\nPlease send me an email or text telling me about yourself! Ideally you would be someone in their 20's who doesn't have any animals though I am okay with cats. Male, female, other, and any sexual orientation is welcome in this household. We all get along very well and we hope you will too! We are a NON CIGARETTE smoking household though we are all definitely 420 friendly if you smoke only in your bedroom and ensure the house does not smell.\n",

	"A large apartment in the inner sunset. There are 2 bedrooms to choose from. The bigger one has a view of downtown and has the morning sun.  The other one is smaller and has the afternoon sun streaming in and rents for $1850\n\nThe apartment is furnished and both rooms have a bed. There is a laundry in the garage, sharing it with the bottom floor apartment. The common space is used by you and me. We share all the bills which include, PG & and the internet. If you have a car there is a possibility you can pay extra for the garage space.  We are one block south of the N-Judah making it easy to get downtown and to the ballpark or the Warriors stadium.  We are 3 blocks south of Golden Gate Park and close to 19th Ave if you need a quick getaway from the city.\n\nThere is a fireplace, but we don’t really use it.

A few nights per week, the TV might be on. We generally keep it relaxed in the house with occasional hangouts, patio fires and wine, and sporadic roommate workout sessions in the living room. During the weekends, we are out and about, enjoying the city and the rest of the west coast, and world.\n\nWe’re 3 men and 1 woman, with a mix of career and hobbies. A few things loved by people in the house: backpacking, skiing/snowboarding, the perfect coffee, car repair, board games, cooking, exercise, surfing, reading, plants, bird watching, cycling, strolling the Presidio with Tucker, donuts, jiu jitsu, quiet time, yoga, travel, fog and did we mention coffee? We think we’re a friendly and varied bunch 🙂\n\nWe’re look for: a friendly, responsible housemate, who is looking to stay at least 9 months. You’re up for occasional housemate hangs, perhaps a spontaneous Tahoe trip or wine around the fire, and you probably appreciate the outdoors.  We all have our own hobbies but like to hang together too.\n\nWe like to keep our house tidy—kitchen especially. One thing to note: no drugs as we're on Federal land here in the Presidio and it's strictly prohibited. \n\nWe’d love to welcome someone new!\n\nRent: $1,595\nSecurity Deposit: $850\n\nOptional Parking Permit: $56.25/month (on the street, directly behind the house)\nUtilities run $140-$180/month (housekeeping every other week, wifi, gas, electricity, water, sewer, and trash pickup)\n\nAvailability: Room is available August 1st.  \n\nIf you're interested, e-mail us with a little info about yourself. We would love to hear about your hobbies and your passions!  Bonus points if you include your favorite movie and favorite invention.\n\nThanks! \nKatrina, Haven, Aaron & Arye (and Tucker!)\n",

	"Greetings, \n\nOne spacious private room, fully furnished, with private balcony, shared bathroom with 1 individual. \n\nLittle info about us:\nWe are 2 working individuals in our 30s who have been living together for few years now, looking for a 3rd roommate around our age. While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways: 580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for. Feel free to ask any questions you might have :)\n\n\nTo move in: 1st month rent + last month rent + $1100 security deposit.\nLooking for someone for a LONG TERM, minimum a year stay. \nRent is $1100 + utilities (generally around $50).\n\nThank you and looking forward to hearing from you :)\n",

	"Highlights include:\n- Bay windows facing west that let in great light in the afternoon\n- large closet behind sliding mirrors\n- large living room w communal storage, TV and tons of plants \n- high ceilings and hardwood floors\n\nRent: $1400 not including utilities (~$150/month for trash, gas, fiber optic internet, electric, water, and cleaning). Length of lease is negotiable but would prefer at least 3 months.\n\nThe housemates: Two males in their late 20's. One of us works from the office 5 days a week, the other is hybrid. When we're not working we like to go outdoors (one of us surfs, the other bikes and climbs), go out for drinks, and host the occasional party.\n\nIdeal roommate: Someone in their 20's or 30's who vibes with us! We're a pretty social house and are always down to hit Dolores park or seek out a fun dj set on the weekends, but week nights are often relatively tame.\n\nMore deets: The room shares a bathroom with another room, while the 3rd bedroom has its own ensuite bathroom. The common area is furnished with a couch and TV but the room is not furnished. The apartment is on the 2nd floor above a laundromat with no shared walls, on a relatively quiet corner with various street parking options. We are very close to hwy 101, 1 block from 24th street, 15 minute walk to BART, and directly above a bus stop on the 27 line.\n\nThe apartment has dark wood laminate floors and beautifully upgraded kitchen appliances. Plenty of sunlight in the apartment and room, and central heat. The laundromat downstairs makes laundry incredibly easy. There is also a shared storage closet for common use.\n\nThanks,\nSean\n    ",

	"We have a room in a 3BR/1Bath opening up August 1st in a North Oakland/ South Berkeley Duplex with 2 women and 1 small dog (very friendly, but means we cannot have any more animals). All genders and identities are welcome. We’re looking for a roommate that is communicative, considerate, down to participate in our weekly cleaning rotation, and who is as engaged in making our home a chill and enjoyable place to live as we are. \n\nWe are in the ground floor unit, the landlord lives upstairs in a separate unit, the backyard is the only shared space. We have a good relationship with the landlord and she is cool with us hanging out in the yard as much as we want. The neighborhood is mellow, fun, and convenient. We love living here. \n\n\n\n Details:\n\n\n- $865.00/month\n\n\n- $1730 deposit( know this is high but landlord has always been good about returning to everyone that moves out so you can expect to get it back unless you destroy something)\n\n\n- month-to-month lease\n\n\n- Unfurnished (~11’x12’) room with closet and windows along west wall\n\n\n- Full kitchen with full-size refrigerator, gas stove, dishwasher, and shared appliances.\n\n\n- Washer/dryer in unit\n\n\n- Shared bathroom\n\n\n- The shared backyard is mostly brick and garden, very sunny, full of flowers, and fairly private\n\n\n- Lots of room to hang out, loads of natural sunlight throughout the year\n\n\n- Small amount of shared storage in the kitchen and living room \n\n\n-Walking distance to Ashby Bart, Berkeley Bowl, Telegraph Wholefoods, multiple bus lines, coffee shops, restaurants, Starry Plough, etc. \n\n\n- Mostly quiet neighborhood\n\n\n-Decent street parking, no driveway or garage\n\n\n-Noise considerations: this is an old house and the walls are pretty thin. The available bedroom shares a wall with one of our bedrooms and the dining room and some sound travels between rooms and also from upstairs. We try to be mindful late at night/ early in the morning and hope you would do the same, but also a tolerance of a small amount of noise is necessary to be happy here. \n\n\n- Accessibility: There are 5 steps from street level to the front door, not wheelchair accessible. Not a scent free space(though we do use mostly low scent products and appreciate a housemate that does the same).\n\n\n-Landlord requires credit check and references as part of application\n\n\n\n\nWe are both in our 30's. One of us works in theater production and the other is a graduate student and massage therapist. We both have many crafty-type hobbies we work on in the common areas from time to time. We have lots of houseplants and more are always welcome :) One of us pole dances and there is a pole in the dining room(if you pole or want to learn you are welcome to use it!). We both enjoy cooking and using our house as a space to unwind and recharge. As housemates our vibe is friendly and considerate but we live independent lives and have our own things going on. We like to check in when having a group of people over, but are open and accepting of having partners and friends over a reasonable amount. We value open communication about any issues that come up. Both of our schedules vary a bit but the house is usually quiet by 10/11pm. The dog that lives here is loving, sweet, playful, and aggressively cuddly. It is ideal if whoever moves in is a dog type of person. She will greet you with excitement and shake you down for pets on a daily basis. \nOne of us has lived here for 8 years and the other for 3 and we are really interested in finding someone who is a good fit for the place and for us as house mates. \n\n\n\nIf you're interested please reach out and tell us about yourself and what you're looking for in a glusing situation, and ask any questions you might have.\n    ",

	"Roommate wanted for shared home in Petaluma:  Looking for 1 housemate to join a friendly shared (between 3 persons including you) 2200 sq foot/4 bedroom house in Petaluma, starting after July 9th,  2023.  Your room ($1250 per month): 144 sq foot, unfurnished, with 2 windows, western facing so lots of light. You share a bathroom with 1 other (amazing:) female identifying person.  The interior common areas are mostly furnished (but if you have items of your own, we can discuss how to include:) and consist of a “great” room (living, dining, kitchen area with refrigerator) and a separate pantry with a second refrigerator, sink, washer,and dryer. We have lots of outdoor space and are just starting to develop the garden/landscaping so welcome anyone who likes to get their hands in the dirt and grow things:). There is a separate front yard with two chaise lounge chairs as well a main outdoor BBQ area with patio table & chairs flanked by another lounge area all located right off the great room/main entrance.  The house is located on a few acre farm so there is off-street parking within the gate that surrounds the entire property.  A very social (and cool) indoor/outdoor cat named Griff lives with us but tends to enter/exit and sleep in my room.  Unfortunately the landlord does not want any other pets at this time. On a day-to-day basis we all do our own things, and are independent, but we do have a communal consciousness to how we care for our home so we want someone who wants to live like that as well.  We care about finding the best ways to co-exist together and in general are pretty organic but still intentional about things.  We are positive, assume the best, consider others, communicate simply as we go along, and talk about things as needed so good “people” skills are valued and important to us.  There are a few other dwellings on the property and we have good relationships with the folks that live there. We tend to gather with them (and other friends who we each want to invite) for “family” style dinners here and there (every few weeks) and also host small house parties/outdoor gatherings a handful of times a year. Sometimes we have had group “game” or movie nights. No smoking indoors, nor cigarette butts in yard outdoors please. Must be 420 & (moderate consumption:) alcohol friendly. Would be ideal if you work outside the home, especially in the afternoons/evenings, in order to stagger all of our work schedules and optimize private time in common spaces as well.  That being said we sometimes cook, watch something, or hang out together as it feels right too.  Rent includes utilities (water, gas, trash, inet).  Also is $100 per person per month for electricity (an estimate based on past usage averaged over the entire year for heat) but if our bill exceeds that allotment due to high usage we contribute the difference split between us three ways. Month-to-month lease, but preference is for longer leases (if all is going well and everyone is happy) or if not we are open to you moving on to something that might work better for you. 1 month security deposit/30 days notice. DM me for a phone call to learn more and see if we might be a good fit for each other. Note:  I am currently traveling, but can show the space and meet starting July 8th:)\n",

	"Hi potential housemate *waves*! Thanks for stopping by to read my ad - if you like what you see don't hesitate to email to learn more.\n\n**About theApartment**:\n- 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment. The total rent is currently $2,405, and we split it evenly $1262.50 each. You get the bigger room and bigger closet with (partial) ocean view, and I get the assigned parking space. This is a great deal, since people moving into the same complex now pay over $3200/ month for the same size apartment we have. Why yes, I have lived here since the dawn of time; why do you ask?\n- Your room has a huge window facing west (the ocean! sunsets!), and one whole wall is a mirrored closet. So there's a *ton* of closet space, plus bathroom and kitchen space.\n- Apartment is fully furnished (except your room). This would be a great place for someone who wants to live in a nicely decorated place but doesn't want to do any of the decorating work themselves.\n- No pets :(\n-also in the complex, and available for use anytime: swimming pool, fitness center, sauna, and \"business center\" (i.e. the main office will fax/copy things for you)\n\n**About the Neighborhood**:\n- Pacifica Manor district, beachside\nWithin 2-3 blocks or less you can reach: Safeway, Walgreens, post office, gourmet deli, butchers, sushi, two pizza/ Italian restaurants, three taquerias, a non-Starbucks coffee hangout (plus two actual Starbucks), authentic English fish 'n chips, two bakeries (one that makes amazing bread and the other amazing desserts), a Chinese restaurant, two hot pot restaurants, Middle Eastern restaurant, chicken 'n waffle (cone) spot, soon to open ice cream parlor (Booza style!!), McDonalds, a gas station with honest mechanics, another gas station, 24 hour fitness gym, hot yoga, a place where you can learn to scuba dive and/or swim, and probably a ton more stuff that I'm forgetting. We have a walkability score of 74, which is pretty great for the 'burbs. Also lots of amazing hiking in the area and a spot to parasail within walking distance if you're into that!\n- The ocean is less than half a block from the apartment. The sound of surf will lull you to sleep. Really, this area is fantastic. And it's really close to the city...\n- 15-20 minutes door to door for most SF locations (without traffic). It takes less time to get from the mission to our place than from the Mission to outer sunset or the marina.\n\n**About Me (Your New Roommate)**:\nfemale, adult (mumbles age)\nnon-smoker/ drinker\n- neat/ clean/quiet/ contentious roommate - personality wise I'm outgoing and friendly\n- artsy and interesting, with a solid sense of humor. I like exploring, traveling, theater, improv, karaoke, painting, arting (it's a word!), hanging out with friends, and learning new things.\n- occasionally watches TV online (e.g. no cable); seem to attract friends that don't.\n- value kindness and consideration for other people, regardless of gender, race, orientation, etc. I *strongly* believe that the key to good roommate relations is respect, consideration, empathy, and good conflict resolution skills.\n\n**About You**:\n-roughly late 20's-40's\n-no smoking (including cannabis, though edibles=OK), heavy drinking, or heavy drugs\n-clean, kind, contentious, and quiet (no midnight bongo drum sessions).\n-considerate and respectful in all things, and just a generally Good Person\n-No couples :(. While the room itself is a good size, there is only one bathroom, and that can get crowded quickly with three full time people.\n\nCOVID STUFF:\nI'm fully vaccinated and mostly work from home. I'm also immunocompromised, so I mask in public and generally do my best to avoid COVID, because there's more chance it would be serious or lead to long COVID for me.\n\n**Fine Print**:\n-Utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, wifi, and household/cleaning supplies) generally run $100-120 each per month.\n-Willing to make a 1 year commitment.\n- Room is available now. Security deposit is $700.\n\nCool? Great. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more about me (your host, AJ) or the apartment, shoot me an email. To avoid spammers/ people who aren't reading this, please include your favorite ice cream flavor. Re: spammers - this has gotten much worse and it seems all want is my phone number. For this reason first contact will be via zoom, and we can call/ schedule in person visit from there.\n",

	"Hi! I am a 37 y/o cishet white woman originally from Seattle, WA, I have lived in the Bay Area for 17 years. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice, and a minor in Art.  I am passionate about environmental justice, food sovereignty, and the intersection of art and activism. I am committed to doing my part in the fight for liberation and dismantling systems of oppression. I currently work full-time at a grocery store in San Francisco. Some of my interests include making art (such as drawing, painting, and screen printing), music, tarot reading, horror movies, cooking vegetarian & vegan food (I am vegetarian but am okay with meat being cooked around me), taking care of my indoor plant babies, and I am enthusiastic about learning more about gardening and growing food. \n\nI would love to find a home that feels safe, solid, and cozy. I have had many years of experience living in shared houses. I am very mindful, accepting, and respectful of all identities. I care greatly about creating a home where everyone feels safe and accepted. I value open, honest, trauma-informed communication. I am always open to talk about any conflict or issue that may arise, even when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. I am very conscious of how I impact and live in shared spaces. I am dedicated to reflecting on my own privilege, and I am continually learning how to be a better accomplice against oppression. \n\nI am very kind, empathetic, and supportive. I am an introvert who loves human connection and also needs a good amount of alone time to recharge. I enjoy spending time with my roommates and creating community in the house and am also considerate of my roommates' own space and time and respect their boundaries. I am respectful of the common spaces in the house and am good at keeping these clean. I am also not a neat-freak and understand if there is a little mess, as life and busy schedules can sometimes get in the way. I occasionally have a friend or two over, and have a couple drinks now and then, but I don't bring the party home. I am also 420-friendly. I do not have any pets of my own, but I love animals and am comfortable living in a household with fur babies. \n\nI am looking for a private, unfurnished room in the San Francisco Bay Area (preferably SF, Daly City, Oakland, or Berkeley) with women or nonbinary roommates. My budget is around $1300/month. My preferred move-in date is end of July. \n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your household, I would love to hear from you! Take care and best of luck in your housemate search!\n\nBest,\nM\n",

	"Hello, my name is Kevin. I am 46 years old and I am looking for a room, mobile home or studio to rent in the Santa Cruz area. I am very quiet, considerate and keep to myself. I would prefer an older roommate or roommates who are as mature and considerate as I am. Perhaps a single home owner that has a room available because of divorce or empty nest. The only thing I truly wish is to have the possible future option of getting 1 Teacup Chihuahua. No drugs, no drinks, no smoking. I am way over the partying years. I just want somewhere I can come home and be at peace. I lead a simple life and have very little material possessions or baggage. I have held the same job for the past 12 years and I also drive for Door Dash to get ahead, so money saved. No problem signing a year lease if it is a good fit. My monthly rent budget is no more than $1,200 based on my annual income. I'm pretty much alone in the world, so sharing housing is my only option even though I make what would be considered adequate in most cities. Cheap ol' Santa Cruz.\nContact me if you think that I might be the perfect fit for you. Thank you.\n",

	"The Inner Sunset… You know it, you love it. It’s got tons of great restaurants and shops, it’s right next to Golden Gate Park, right down the hill from UCSF, and the weather is a perfect mix of sunny and overcast. We have a room open in our three-bedroom, 1.5 bath apartment, with a great living room, a full kitchen, and a beautiful sunny (when sunny) garden out back. The N Judah stops on our corner. Our apartment is great, and we’re looking to complete it with someone who will mesh well with us and our lifestyles.\n\nThere are two of us living here currently. We’re two dudes in our early forties who have been friends for many years. One of us is a teacher, and the other is a stagehand, so we can have wildly different schedules, but still manage to sometimes cook together and hang out around the house. It’s a pretty social environment. We have a bunch of cool friends who visit us occasionally, and sometimes we’ll have a movie night or a small party. We’re 420-friendly and half queer, and are looking for a housemate who naturally fits.\n\nYou should be chill, down to earth, and be on top of your shit financially and easy to live with. Ideally you have your own friends who will be friendly and compatible with ours. We pitch in on chores together, and don’t really have a schedule or a rotation. We drink occasionally, usually just a beer or glass of wine with dinner. You should be similar, and not drink to excess regularly. \n\nThe room is 10’x13’, with a small closet. Its windows open onto a sky well which gets indirect light and is perfect for a little window garden. The living room is cozy, with some comfy couches, a dry bar, dining area, 5.1 surround, a turntable, and cool lighting. We have central heating, robust wi-fi and Xfinity's fastest residential internet. We split Comcast and PG&E three ways, which usually comes out to about $100-$130 per person depending on the time of year. The kitchen is well stocked and full of all the gadgets, including a dishwasher. We have a washer and dryer in the unit, and a fire pit in the garden.  We love animals, (one of us is Team Cat, one of us loves both!) but cannot accommodate pets at this time.\n\nGet in touch if it seems like a good fit. Please tell us a bit about yourself, your schedule, hobbies, and what you’re like around the house.  Not including this in your email may result in no reply! \n\nWe’d like to meet people soon, but our schedules are kind of busy. We can meet people over the weekend, or evenings during the week. Please let us know when would work for you. We look forward to meeting you!\n\n\n",

We like to play music (always open to wearing headphones for folks with conflicting sleep schedules) and start most days with yoga in the living room.  \n\nWe're a colorful, vibrant, outspoken, active, open-minded, queer/diversity-friendly, and 420-friendly household with an emphasis on sustainable living practices (collecting grey water, cloth towels rather than paper towels, biodegradable unscented detergents, soaps, etc). \n\nOur household is free of strong, artificial fragrances.   So folks who use strong perfumes, air fresheners, colognes, deodorants, etc. would need to make a life adjustment or kindly look elsewhere for lodging. \n\nWe're looking for an independent, mature, clean, professional, respectful individual who is capable of being proactive and dispassionate in communication with their roommates when/if issues arise.  Our ideal roommate has a life outside of the house and has interests and goals that they pursue.  \n\nWe don't currently have a chore system and do not have time to create or manage one.  So the ideal candidate has enough of an appreciation/respect for their living spaces that they regularly take for small cleaning projects AND/OR has a mind for management and can help to create an equitable cleaning system.\n\nDisqualifying factors:\n-Pets (negotiable)\n-Loud parties\n-Frequent overnight guests\n-People with sensitive ears / light sleepers\n-Cigarette smoking\n-Work from home\n-School from home\n-Religious fervor \n-Frequent/elaborate kitchen use\n\nOne room is currently available, the other will be available mid-July  \nMove-in cost = 1st month (1300) + deposit (1300) = 2600 per room\n\nIf you're interested, please respond with some information about yourself. \n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

	"Hi, we have a room available at our place in the Dogpatch. The room is large, sunny, and has sliding doors to our deck. The bathroom is shared, but with only one roomate. \n\nThe aparment has three bedrooms, two full baths, and is on the top floor with a full private deck. The living room and kitchen are furnished, but we also have some room for you to add things if you'd like. We are litterally two blocks from the 22nd St. Caltrain station, one block from the Muni, and four blocks from the I-280 ramp. \n\nWe're looking for a clean and respectful roommate, with similar schedules. We're two professionals in our late 30's. A European tech sociologist & cook extraordinaire, and a genome biologist & ocean lover (surfing, free diving, kiting). We like grabbing a drink or a bite once in a while, but also have pretty tight schedules, so we really like to keep things relaxed and pretty low key at home during the week. \n\nThe neighborhood, the Dogpatch, it's amazing. Almost always sunny and 10 degrees warmer than the rest of SF. Workshops, brunch, galleries, gourmet ice cream, breweries, amazing restaurants, rock climbing, and literally less than 10 minutes from the 22nd St. Caltrain Station, Muni, and I-280 access. It is also in a flat part of town so it's also perfect for biking to a lot of places.\n\nThe rent for the room is $1,650 per month + 1/3 utilities. The sublet is month to month, with 45 days notice, and a 2 month deposit. Ideally we are looking for someone that is aiming to stay for the longer term, eg more than six months, but we may consider shorter terms. \n\nTo come see it, please tell us a little bit about yourself and what you are doing in SF. If you can share a linkedin or social profile to help show you are a working human able to pay rent, that would really help. We'll then get back to you and figure out a time for you to come see it.

	"Hi there, my name is Moe and I'm subletting my room for about a year, from Oct 1 2023 to July 1st, 2024.\n\nOriginal rent is $1133/mo, discounted rate is $1000/mo for the care of my cat, Panna Cotta!\n\nAbout the house: We are 3 white queers (K and A are my roommates), two of us are trans, including me! We're in the upper unit of a duplex on a side street thats relatively quiet with easy street parking. We have a huge private backyard with 3 garden beds that's perfect for gardening, parties, and laying about in the hammock! In-unit w/d, dishwasher, garbage disposal. We have 1 parking space which you can snag if the other K and A haven't already. There are stairs up to the front door and down to the backyard. We're 420 friendly but no cigarettes. Sorry, no couples or more pets!\n\nMy cat: He's a large (over 18 lbs) long-hair Maine Coon (at least that's what I think, he was rescued and I never DNA tested him) named Panna Cotta! He's a very sweet boy that enjoys being in the same room as people, and it incredibly low maintenance. He doesn't have any medications, illnesses, etc that could potentially flare up. The most he needs is kinda pricey vet food since he got surgery on his bladder a few years ago. He will let you know when he wants cuddles, and when he wants you to stop. Doesn't knock things off shelves which is nice! Overall a very chill cat. His litter box is inside my room and due to the lack of floor space in the rest of the apartment, it cannot be moved elsewhere. I have a litter genie which is INCREDIBLE at keeping things smelling like nothing and a great tool to have.\n\nAbout the room: Fully Furnished! Full-sized bed with storage drawers underneath. Medium sized and bright! Includes a small closet, and the connected bathroom is shared jack-and-jill style with my roommate A. We both have similar standards when it comes to bathroom cleanliness and it is routinely cleaned and maintained by the both of us.\n\nWhat we're looking for: We want to keep this a queer home, and prioritize BIPOC folks! A and K would like to be a part of the process, since obviously they would be sharing the home with someone new, and in A's case the shared bathroom. We would like someone who enjoys to be socially engaged to an extent, because we like to host events at our home, including craft and game nights, as well as larger parties in the backyard. You don't have to be a mega extrovert of course, but because our home is a small hub for queer community, we would like someone to be open to participate somewhat in the planning of things! :) Just someone who is clean, friendly, and obviously a cat person and will take good care of my furbaby while I'll away getting my masters!\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!! Thank you so much!\n",

So ideally we are looking for a non-drinker and non-smoker(470 friendly), or someone who will toke outside the building as it is the rule for the building residents. Again we are marijuanna friendly but it has to be done discreetly. We have a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom courtyard apartment with a pool, fast WiFi, only month to month agreement (30 day written notice to leave anytime), Utilities and other fees included in the $485 rent . . Available now, a credit check must be performed with the management online. If approved, you would only sign onto a month to month lease, so you need only give a 30 day notice to vacate . Parking will be shared with only David, perhaps bi-weekly, street parking is usually not an issue to find in front of the building. Let us know what makes you a great roommate. Please be clean and organized and have fresh outlook on life. We are not looking for our next best friend, but nor are we looking to live with a total stranger. So here’s to good living and finding a place to call home.\n\n\n**PLEASE PROVIDE AN EMAIL ADDRESS OR A PHONE NUMBER WHERE YOU CAN BE REACHED TO ENSURE A RESPONSE.!!!\n",

	"Hello, \n\nI am looking for a new living arrangement. I am interested in having a like-minded roommate or roommates. SF is preferred, but I am open to considering other locations. After searching CL for housing and not really finding the ideal situation, I have decided to post an ad on CL in the hopes of seeing what's out there. \n\nAbout me: I am an associate professor at San Francisco State University. I am 40 years old and have lived in the Bay Area for the past 7 years. Currently, I live near SFSU campus, where I have resided on and off for about 6 years now. I have a month-to-month lease, so I can move whenever.  I have no pets. In terms of my schedule, I am typically at work on campus 2-3 days/week during the semester. I like to get out of town and go on road trips on the weekends, but also explore all that the Bay Area has to offer. \n\nAnyway, I am putting the feelers out to see what type of opportunity presents itself for a new cool place to call home. \n\nBest wishes, \nIan\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/iandunham/\n\n",

I need this to be a quick turnaround so the quicker you can tour it and send in materials, the better! About the place... It's a 3 bedroom apartment on the 4th floor of a walk up building. I'd much prefer to just have 1 roommate and have us share the 3rd bedroom as a small office when we're working from home. If there's space, maybe throw a couch in there and have it be a guest bedroom. The bedrooms aren't the biggest so having the 3rd room as a bonus one would be great. No washer/dryer in the building but there's central air. I also loved the rooftop when I toured it.

While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways:  580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for.

	"I am a single mom living with my two sons (9 and 6) who are with me during the week and sometimes on the weekend (shared custody with their dad).  We are pretty active, sometimes rambunctious household during the day, and at night quiet and asleep.  The kids have very limited amount of screen time, so they are pretty active in the house.  We are all social and outgoing, and accustomed to living with a roommate.  Our current roommate has lived with us for about 3 years and is moving out to relocate out of state. I currently work primarily from home (remotely) and only go into the office occasionally.\n\nWe have both front and back yard, with fire pit.  the square footage of the house is 1350, I don't know the square footage of the room, but its sizeable.  \n\nParking is street parking only. no off street parking available, but 95% of the time there's spots available in front of the house.\n\nAll utilities (including wifi) are included with rent. \n\nwasher/dryer.\n\nMove in costs: first & last month, plus security deposit of $500\n\nThe room is available now, and can be pro rated depending on when you move in. No lease required, month to month is fine with me.  I've lived with two other roommates in the last 5 years.  One stayed for 2 years and the most recent one stayed for 3 years.  I've always just gone with an informal month to month arrangement. \n\nOpen to pets.\n\nlet me know if you have any questions!\n\nJennie\n",
	"Seeking a Great Roommate\n\nBig lovely room available in shared household on August 21st/22nd! \nI’m seeking someone who is a good communicator, willing to share in household chores, and likes a balance of doing our own thing and being friendly when we’re both around. \n\nThe place: \nThe apartment is a cozy, sweet 2-bedroom corner unit on the second floor (one flight of stairs to reach) in Duboce Triangle - one block from beautiful Duboce park. The available bedroom is large - 12 x 15, and has a bay window, some built-in shelving, and a good sized closet, located outside the room in the hallway. Bedroom is currently lightly furnished with a bed, lamp and nightstand, but if you want to bring your own furniture, I can empty the room. The apartment has a sunny, stocked kitchen and a cozy furnished living room. Kitchen has a gas stove, fridge, microwave, toaster, but alas, no dishwasher. The split bathroom has a tub for soaking. Laundry is located downstairs in the building and takes credit cards.\n\nAbout the Area:\nEvery time I tell someone I live in Duboce Triangle, they light up and say “I LOVE Duboce Triangle!!” It’s easy to love it here - quaint, peaceful tree-lined streets all around, and a beautiful nearby park to catch the abundant sunshine. Both the N Judah and the Church st MUNI station are short blocks away, and you can walk to the 16th st BART in 15 minutes. The Castro, the Mission, and the Lower Haight are all right here, and there are tons of cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby. It’s in the geographic center of the city, so you can get most places pretty quickly from here. If you have a car, you can get a parking permit for the area, and street parking is relatively easy - I usually find a spot fairly quickly, and rarely need to park more than a couple of blocks away.\n\nSome things to consider: \nApartment currently has no pets, but I’m open to a well-behaved, mostly quiet dog. (Sorry, no cats, I’m allergic). No smoking of any kind in the house (this is not a 420 friendly household per my allergies/sensitivities). The house is scent-free. Please no perfume, incense, scented candles. The space is only big enough for one additional person (sorry, no couples). There’s no TV in the living room. \n\nAbout the Rent and Move In costs:\n$1695/month includes utilities and internet. Move in costs will be the first month’s rent, plus a deposit equal to one month’s rent, for a total of $3,390. \nYour lease agreement will be month to month, one year minimum stay preferred. \n\nAbout me: \nI’m a woman, originally from the East Coast - responsible, friendly, direct, a good communicator, and easy to get along with. I lead a pretty busy life, but often like to just relax at home too. Working full time and also currently in school for a Master’s degree. I prefer a pretty quiet house, so I’m able to study/work from home.\n\nAbout my potential roommate:\n-Easygoing, responsible, fun, fairly chill/quiet lifestyle\n-Non-smoking, non-fragrance or incense using\n-Sober or light drinkers okay but no heavy drinkers, drug use/partiers\n-Prefers a clean/tidy household and able to do house chores and pay rent without being reminded\n-Preferably someone with minimal stuff (apartment is totally furnished and there’s not much in the way of storage space outside of the room/closet). There is space in the apartment for a bicycle, if you have one.\n\nIf you’re interested and think you might be a match, please do get in touch and tell me about yourself! \nThanks - and I look forward to hearing from you!!\n    ",

It works well for us because we are all good, likable, agreeable and BUSY!

It’s furnished with a twin mattress but you’re welcome to bring your own twin or full if you prefer.\n\nIn our living room we are blessed and spoiled to have an EPIC 120” home theater with 5 channel surround sound (including a subwoofer for each channel! 🤪💥🤯)\nIt’s pretty fun just having a movie night.\n\nWe’re a short walk to the bay marina area and park.

The other roommate (26) is a PhD student from the UK who enjoys biking, drawing and cooking Chinese food. They value a peaceful, clean living environment.\n\nThis is a good fit for someone who is ok with a cozy room and would enjoy everything else the spacious house and backyard have to offer. We’re looking for someone who is clean and tidy and who communicates openly.\n",

	"Come join our spacious and sunny apartment in the Mission!\n\nTitillating details:\n-\tEntire top floor of a 3-unit building, ~ 1200 square feet,\n-\tBedroom is 10x12 feet plus closet. Our previous roommate had a Queen bed, a massive desk, and extra room for activities\n-\tVery large living room, with vaulted ceilings for contemplating the universe\n-\tSmall deck for morning sun, afternoon workouts (bench/weights available), evening bbqs, general decking \n-\tCommunity courtyard with the other units\n-\tStrategically situated in ‘Burrito Alley’\n\nThere’s a third bedroom that’s a shared home office/guest room which you’re welcome to use). Always the option to make your guests sleep on floor if annoying. \n\nWe are on a “slow street” with all bedrooms facing an interior garden/courtyard, so it’s very quiet considering how close we are the 24th Street action. The neighborhood is walkable and excellent for both local flavor and commuting in either direction.\n\nNo television, but there’s a projector set up for movie nights.\n\nAbout us: John (38) and Nasheen (31), both Canadian, moved London to SF 2 years ago. Nasheen is a defense attorney and John is a chemical engineer/vaguely a tech guy. We both work typical office hours in hybrid jobs; home 2-3 days a week. We’re usually relaxed during the week & head out on weekends (our favorite spot is Public Works).  We then try for weekly hikes to sweat out our sins. \n\nWe’re hoping to find a roommate who’s easy to get along with and helps create a good vibe at home.\n\nRent is $1700 plus bills which total to about $60 (including 170Mbit/s+ internet). If we all decide to rent the third room rent would be ~$1250.\n",
	"We’re looking for a housemate to move into our 3br 3bath condo in Southwest Berkeley. The room is available August 1st and the leasing term is for 1 year. The room has its own private bathroom, as well as a small private balcony of its own. The pictures supplied show the bedroom furnished, but it will be empty for you when you move in.\n\nOur apartment is 2.5 miles away from Berkeley campus(~15 min bike ride or 8 min drive), 1.4 mi from Ashby BART and a 5 minute walk to Berkeley Bowl West.

A security deposit of $1,333 is required at move-in in addition to the last month's rent (total at move-in : $4,023). \n\nThe common areas include: \n\n•\tLarge kitchen with large island, modern stainless steel appliances + dishwasher  \n•\tFully furnished living room\n•\tLaundry (in-unit washer/dryer) \n•\tPrivate roof deck. \n\nAbout us:\nWe (Kim, 30F and Jesse, 27M) are both PhD students at Berkeley studying Molecular and Cell Biology. We both work quite a bit in the lab, so we tend to keep to ourselves at the end of the day and generally keep things lowkey when at home. We're quite social by nature though, so it's not unusual for us to go out on the weekends or once in a while have friends over for dinner. Preferred roommate would be another grad student at Cal, but we're open minded to other types of young professionals who are interested.\n    ",

	"Room rent is $1100, partial work exchange possible, plus shared utilities (currently about $125 per person all utilities included).  We're located in a quiet and safe area of Maxwell Park in Oakland, less than half a mile from Mills/NU.  Move-in requires first and last month rent, plus $1,100 security deposit. \n\nMy housemate is moving out and I’m looking to fill her room. I'm a responsible, mature female and I work as an environmental consultant.  \nI love animals, going out dancing, seeing live concerts/shows, and exploring mama nature. I'm the type of person that can find beauty in the little things, and I consider myself to be a free-spirited individual. I like to keep a clean home, the type of space where I can walk around barefoot, and just kickback and relax at the end of the day. I usually like to keep to myself, but I'm always down to talk or hang out if you want company. I scored as an \"ISFP\" on the personality score, if you're curious lol. I'm pretty chill overall, understanding, and easy to live with as long as we maintain boundaries and responsibilities. I work out of the home some of the week so I may not be around that much, and I often go out when I want to socialize. However, company is always welcome, and I don't mind overnight guests as long as you're respectful of the home, and mindful of my schedule. The other roommate is a cat, interested in sleep and meditation, food and play! I occasionally like to have my homies over for dinner, movie/game nights, and drinks. You're always welcome to join or invite friends.\n\nThe room itself is pleasant, currently furnished but can be fully or partially unfurnished.  12’ x 11’ not counting a small walk-in closet (4 ½’ x 3’ 10”). With 2 East-facing windows, it is well insulated (fiberglass and recycled jeans insulation in walls and ceiling), was updated with dimmable LED lighting, 2 USB ports for direct charging, new high efficiency baseboard heater, and is cable-ready.  To give you an idea, the bed shown in the pics is a full-size.\n\nThe house has hardwood floors throughout, new appliances, a deck, excellent natural light.  Lots of plants, room for yours as well. \nThe bathroom is super fun -- radiant floor heat, excellent light with solar-operated skylight (more interesting plants), instant and unlimited hot water (Groher) which flows to the backyard through grey water lines.\n\nRoom is available to a pleasant, mature individual, preferably female (civilized males considered, please see form), financially secure, open in their communication style and friendly with their housemate, respectful of common areas.\nMust like cats, and you can’t have a dog because my previously mentioned 9-year old tabby is terribly afraid of dogs. I don't mind small pets like reptiles or other small creatures, just let me know about them in advance.\n\nI go away a few months per year, and if you’re interested I can lower the rent to $700 per month if/when you take care of my cat when I’m not home. Not a deal breaker - if you’d rather not get involved with her care I can make other arrangements.\n\nSounds good? Would you like to introduce yourself?  Please fill out the attached form. \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-CKTu3-5UT7XqjMizK4k1upLIjmSHcnc3WRWQIVnfVg/edit\nIf we think we may be a match, let’s do a quick Zoom and I can have you over.\n    ",

	"We have a private room available for the perfect female flatmate.\n\nThe room is pretty big (about 15'x13'), has a nicely-sized closet, and is very quiet. It's unfurnished, but the rest of the house is completely furnished. We have a backyard garden and on-site laundry, but no parking. But if you have a car, you'll be happy to learn there is always plenty of street parking in the area (honestly! it's weird).\n\nYour prospective flatmates are a married couple (hetero), who maintain two households. Mrs. Flatmate works in the East Bay and stays there M-Th, spending weekends SF. Mr. Flatmate stays in SF full time, holding down the fort. It may seem like an odd arrangement, but it works for us, and we've had housemates for many years, so this isn't a new experiment we're just trying out.\n\nWe also have a friendly cat in the house, so if you're allergic or just averse, it's not the right fit. In fact, you should probably be at least slightly positive on cats rather than neutral or \"willing to tolerate if they stay away from me\" (because she probably won't). No additional pets are allowed by lease with the property owner, so fellow pet parents are not an option.\n\nRent is a $1450/month, which includes all utilities, internet, and a housekeeper who comes every other week. We'll need one month's security deposit in addition to the first month's rent, so the move-in cost is $2900. There's no lease term, but we prefer someone who is looking for a long-term situation. Ours is a very stable home, with only a couple roommate changes over the past six or seven years. People tend to stick around (because it's affordable and a great place to live!), and that's our preference too. We're definitely looking for someone who wants a place to call home for a while rather than a person who just wants somewhere to crash for a few months.\n",
	"My husband and I (31f, 27m) are looking for a roommate in our Fulton home.  All utilities and internet are included in the rent.\n\nTHE ROOM\nThe bedroom has a private entrance and it’s own parking spot. It’s connected to our garage so you have your own separate area but are welcome in the house. You’ll have a bathroom that is mostly private but sometimes our guests use it. The bedroom is large (12x20ish) and has a door to our backyard as well. You are welcome to paint it or customize it how you wish. There’s plenty of parking for guests if you have any \n\nTHE HOUSE\nOur house is in the country on a busy road. It’s near the freeway and right on the cusp of Santa Rosa. We have 1/2 an acre with chickens, ducks, a garden, 2 dogs and a cat. We also have a really cool backyard bar that you can use. We have a kitchen with all the cooking tools and spices you would need, a washer and dryer, lots of freezer space, and a second fridge at our bar outside should you ever need extra room. We have a woodstove inside as well as a nice living room and dining room area. There’s plenty of storage space in our garage should you need. There’s AC in the house but not in the bedroom you’d be renting though I’m happy to install a unit when summer comes around. \n\nABOUT US \nMy husband and I own the house. We have had roommates for many years and they usually end up being some of our best friends. We are very easy to get along with and are respectful to live with. Last year we decided to renovate the bathroom which is why we are roommate free right now. 😁 I work Mon-Fri 8am-4:30p and my husband works Sun-Wed 6am-6pm. We both love to hike, play video games, watch tv, and hang out with friends. We are friendly and are happy with roommates who want to hang out or ones that prefer to keep to themselves. I am an outgoing, active person and my husband is more shy and quiet. We are a 420 friendly household though cigarettes are not allowed to be smoked in the house (but you’re welcome to go to the bar or anywhere outside)\n\nIDEAL ROOMMATE\nWe are happy living with people who want to hang out with us or with someone who prefers to keep to themselves.  Cats are okay to bring but no dogs please. If you like gardening I’m happy to give you a spot for plants. There’s no expectation you help with yard work or anything. We keep pretty clean and while sometimes we might make a mess it is always cleaned up by the next day at the latest. We would like the same with our potential roommate. I cook a lot so someone who was in the kitchen less would be great but I’m happy to share the space!\n",
	"Hello! I have a room for rent in a 3 story townhouse in Cotati right at the train station available right now!\n\nAbout the room: The room is located on the second floor and shares a bathroom with only one other roommate. This area of the house is sectioned off from the main living area so it stays very quiet unless you like to keep the door to your entryway open. the roommate you will be next to is a very nice young man.  He is a very quiet guy and keeps to himself.  The room is unfurnished and will have new carpet.\n\nAbout the house: The house is a 3 story townhouse with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. On the bottom floor is the 2 car garage (we use this for a pool table and game room) as well as a bedroom and bathroom. On the second floor is the kitchen, living room two bedrooms and a bathroom (this is where your room is). On the third floor is the master suite. The kitchen comes with all appliances and accessories you could possibly need and you will have your own separate cabinet for food storage. A new washer and fairly new dryer are located inside the house. The house stays pretty clean and is hardwood floor in all common areas and carpet in the bedrooms. The house is furnished tastefully except for the bedrooms which are unfurnished.\nThere is plenty of parking on the street and if you have an electric car you can charge at the train station. It is an easy walk to Oliver's, Starbucks and Energy Fitness (8 mins max) and a nice walk from SSU (25 mins for me to get to my classroom and I move very slowly).\n\nAbout the roommates:\nBOTTOM FLOOR- This room is taken by my younger brother (26). He works full time at home and stays in his room a majority of the time. He is very respectful and enjoys being on his own or hanging out with others. He has 2 cats who you would absolutely never even know lived in the house. \n\nMIDDLE FLOOR- The room is available on this level. This is the room with a shared bathroom with another tenant who is a young male (mid 20s).  He is very quiet and, like all the others, stays in his room most of the time.\n\nTOP FLOOR- This room is taken by a 27 year old male who is very sweet, quiet and is used to living with many other people.  He also has one cat (Spooky).  You will likely not see Spooky much, he likes to stay in his room.\n\nFor the most part everyone in the house keeps to themselves in their rooms but the living room is furnished and available for anyone to use.\n\nGas, water and garbage are included in rent (all utilities).\n\nPlease send me an email or text telling me about yourself! Ideally you would be someone in their 20's who doesn't have any animals though I am okay with cats. Male, female, other, and any sexual orientation is welcome in this household. We all get along very well and we hope you will too! We are a NON CIGARETTE smoking household though we are all definitely 420 friendly if you smoke only in your bedroom and ensure the house does not smell.\n",

	"A large apartment in the inner sunset. There are 2 bedrooms to choose from. The bigger one has a view of downtown and has the morning sun.  The other one is smaller and has the afternoon sun streaming in and rents for $1850\n\nThe apartment is furnished and both rooms have a bed. There is a laundry in the garage, sharing it with the bottom floor apartment. The common space is used by you and me. We share all the bills which include, PG & and the internet. If you have a car there is a possibility you can pay extra for the garage space.  We are one block south of the N-Judah making it easy to get downtown and to the ballpark or the Warriors stadium.  We are 3 blocks south of Golden Gate Park and close to 19th Ave if you need a quick getaway from the city.\n\nThere is a fireplace, but we don’t really use it.

I prefer someone who is 30+ and is responsible. I will need to check your references and make sure you are financially able to pay rent and bills on time.\n\nI am enclosing a few pictures of your space, but my roommate of 7+ years will be moving out on August 1st to live with his fiancé, so the space is not empty at the moment.\n\nWe have become close, and it felt like a family setting, I would like to continue that feeling.

No cigarette smoke. The city outside is wild and crazy enough without bringing it back here so, we try to keep the place relaxed with relatively few visitors as to have a safe, friendly home base to relax in and/or get work done.

	"Greetings, \n\nOne spacious private room, fully furnished, with private balcony, shared bathroom with 1 individual. \n\nLittle info about us:\nWe are 2 working individuals in our 30s who have been living together for few years now, looking for a 3rd roommate around our age. While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways: 580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for. Feel free to ask any questions you might have :)\n\n\nTo move in: 1st month rent + last month rent + $1100 security deposit.\nLooking for someone for a LONG TERM, minimum a year stay. \nRent is $1100 + utilities (generally around $50).\n\nThank you and looking forward to hearing from you :)\n",

Available 8/1.\n\nLink to video tour https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CCxY0Jk2tjUVZvRfbvVPprFIb_YXX-dp?usp=sharing\n\n* Current roommate is a 60-year old, male former English professor who doesn't smoke and works from home. His schedule is 6a to 10p and he is fairly quiet although you might hear him on teleconferences with clients and students during the day during normal business hours.\n\nABOUT THE APARTMENT:\n* Large bedroom with private entrance\n* Kitchen and bathroom are shared\n* Room is large enough for bed, desk, and small futon\n* There is no shared living room\n* Parking available for $60/ month\n* Available now\n* Bedroom is 18' x 8'\n* Gated complex\n* Updated kitchen with granite countertops\n* Coin-operated washer/ dryer located in building\n* Rent includes water, garbage. Tenant responsible for electricity and gas.\n* Small dogs allowed with pet fee, deposit, and pet references\n* Lease term 12-months\n\nLOCATION:\n- Fantastic, centrally located walker & biker's paradise: 92 walk score, 98 bike score \n- 2 blocks to Whole Foods\n- 3 blocks to Berkeley Bowl, Walgreens\n- 10 blocks to UC Berkeley\n- 3 blocks to Alta Bates Hospital\n- 3 blocks to Shattuck\n- 0.9 miles to Ashby Bart\n    ",
	"Highlights include:\n- Bay windows facing west that let in great light in the afternoon\n- large closet behind sliding mirrors\n- large living room w communal storage, TV and tons of plants \n- high ceilings and hardwood floors\n\nRent: $1400 not including utilities (~$150/month for trash, gas, fiber optic internet, electric, water, and cleaning). Length of lease is negotiable but would prefer at least 3 months.\n\nThe housemates: Two males in their late 20's. One of us works from the office 5 days a week, the other is hybrid. When we're not working we like to go outdoors (one of us surfs, the other bikes and climbs), go out for drinks, and host the occasional party.\n\nIdeal roommate: Someone in their 20's or 30's who vibes with us! We're a pretty social house and are always down to hit Dolores park or seek out a fun dj set on the weekends, but week nights are often relatively tame.\n\nMore deets: The room shares a bathroom with another room, while the 3rd bedroom has its own ensuite bathroom. The common area is furnished with a couch and TV but the room is not furnished. The apartment is on the 2nd floor above a laundromat with no shared walls, on a relatively quiet corner with various street parking options. We are very close to hwy 101, 1 block from 24th street, 15 minute walk to BART, and directly above a bus stop on the 27 line.\n\nThe apartment has dark wood laminate floors and beautifully upgraded kitchen appliances. Plenty of sunlight in the apartment and room, and central heat. The laundromat downstairs makes laundry incredibly easy. There is also a shared storage closet for common use.\n\nThanks,\nSean\n    ",

	"We have a room in a 3BR/1Bath opening up August 1st in a North Oakland/ South Berkeley Duplex with 2 women and 1 small dog (very friendly, but means we cannot have any more animals). All genders and identities are welcome. We’re looking for a roommate that is communicative, considerate, down to participate in our weekly cleaning rotation, and who is as engaged in making our home a chill and enjoyable place to live as we are. \n\nWe are in the ground floor unit, the landlord lives upstairs in a separate unit, the backyard is the only shared space. We have a good relationship with the landlord and she is cool with us hanging out in the yard as much as we want. The neighborhood is mellow, fun, and convenient. We love living here. \n\n\n\n Details:\n\n\n- $865.00/month\n\n\n- $1730 deposit( know this is high but landlord has always been good about returning to everyone that moves out so you can expect to get it back unless you destroy something)\n\n\n- month-to-month lease\n\n\n- Unfurnished (~11’x12’) room with closet and windows along west wall\n\n\n- Full kitchen with full-size refrigerator, gas stove, dishwasher, and shared appliances.\n\n\n- Washer/dryer in unit\n\n\n- Shared bathroom\n\n\n- The shared backyard is mostly brick and garden, very sunny, full of flowers, and fairly private\n\n\n- Lots of room to hang out, loads of natural sunlight throughout the year\n\n\n- Small amount of shared storage in the kitchen and living room \n\n\n-Walking distance to Ashby Bart, Berkeley Bowl, Telegraph Wholefoods, multiple bus lines, coffee shops, restaurants, Starry Plough, etc. \n\n\n- Mostly quiet neighborhood\n\n\n-Decent street parking, no driveway or garage\n\n\n-Noise considerations: this is an old house and the walls are pretty thin. The available bedroom shares a wall with one of our bedrooms and the dining room and some sound travels between rooms and also from upstairs. We try to be mindful late at night/ early in the morning and hope you would do the same, but also a tolerance of a small amount of noise is necessary to be happy here. \n\n\n- Accessibility: There are 5 steps from street level to the front door, not wheelchair accessible. Not a scent free space(though we do use mostly low scent products and appreciate a housemate that does the same).\n\n\n-Landlord requires credit check and references as part of application\n\n\n\n\nWe are both in our 30's. One of us works in theater production and the other is a graduate student and massage therapist. We both have many crafty-type hobbies we work on in the common areas from time to time. We have lots of houseplants and more are always welcome :) One of us pole dances and there is a pole in the dining room(if you pole or want to learn you are welcome to use it!). We both enjoy cooking and using our house as a space to unwind and recharge. As housemates our vibe is friendly and considerate but we live independent lives and have our own things going on. We like to check in when having a group of people over, but are open and accepting of having partners and friends over a reasonable amount. We value open communication about any issues that come up. Both of our schedules vary a bit but the house is usually quiet by 10/11pm. The dog that lives here is loving, sweet, playful, and aggressively cuddly. It is ideal if whoever moves in is a dog type of person. She will greet you with excitement and shake you down for pets on a daily basis. \nOne of us has lived here for 8 years and the other for 3 and we are really interested in finding someone who is a good fit for the place and for us as house mates. \n\n\n\nIf you're interested please reach out and tell us about yourself and what you're looking for in a glusing situation, and ask any questions you might have.\n    ",

	"Roommate wanted for shared home in Petaluma:  Looking for 1 housemate to join a friendly shared (between 3 persons including you) 2200 sq foot/4 bedroom house in Petaluma, starting after July 9th,  2023.  Your room ($1250 per month): 144 sq foot, unfurnished, with 2 windows, western facing so lots of light. You share a bathroom with 1 other (amazing:) female identifying person.  The interior common areas are mostly furnished (but if you have items of your own, we can discuss how to include:) and consist of a “great” room (living, dining, kitchen area with refrigerator) and a separate pantry with a second refrigerator, sink, washer,and dryer. We have lots of outdoor space and are just starting to develop the garden/landscaping so welcome anyone who likes to get their hands in the dirt and grow things:). There is a separate front yard with two chaise lounge chairs as well a main outdoor BBQ area with patio table & chairs flanked by another lounge area all located right off the great room/main entrance.  The house is located on a few acre farm so there is off-street parking within the gate that surrounds the entire property.  A very social (and cool) indoor/outdoor cat named Griff lives with us but tends to enter/exit and sleep in my room.  Unfortunately the landlord does not want any other pets at this time. On a day-to-day basis we all do our own things, and are independent, but we do have a communal consciousness to how we care for our home so we want someone who wants to live like that as well.  We care about finding the best ways to co-exist together and in general are pretty organic but still intentional about things.  We are positive, assume the best, consider others, communicate simply as we go along, and talk about things as needed so good “people” skills are valued and important to us.  There are a few other dwellings on the property and we have good relationships with the folks that live there. We tend to gather with them (and other friends who we each want to invite) for “family” style dinners here and there (every few weeks) and also host small house parties/outdoor gatherings a handful of times a year. Sometimes we have had group “game” or movie nights. No smoking indoors, nor cigarette butts in yard outdoors please. Must be 420 & (moderate consumption:) alcohol friendly. Would be ideal if you work outside the home, especially in the afternoons/evenings, in order to stagger all of our work schedules and optimize private time in common spaces as well.  That being said we sometimes cook, watch something, or hang out together as it feels right too.  Rent includes utilities (water, gas, trash, inet).  Also is $100 per person per month for electricity (an estimate based on past usage averaged over the entire year for heat) but if our bill exceeds that allotment due to high usage we contribute the difference split between us three ways. Month-to-month lease, but preference is for longer leases (if all is going well and everyone is happy) or if not we are open to you moving on to something that might work better for you. 1 month security deposit/30 days notice. DM me for a phone call to learn more and see if we might be a good fit for each other. Note:  I am currently traveling, but can show the space and meet starting July 8th:)\n",

	"Hi potential housemate *waves*! Thanks for stopping by to read my ad - if you like what you see don't hesitate to email to learn more.\n\n**About theApartment**:\n- 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment. The total rent is currently $2,405, and we split it evenly $1262.50 each. You get the bigger room and bigger closet with (partial) ocean view, and I get the assigned parking space. This is a great deal, since people moving into the same complex now pay over $3200/ month for the same size apartment we have. Why yes, I have lived here since the dawn of time; why do you ask?\n- Your room has a huge window facing west (the ocean! sunsets!), and one whole wall is a mirrored closet. So there's a *ton* of closet space, plus bathroom and kitchen space.\n- Apartment is fully furnished (except your room). This would be a great place for someone who wants to live in a nicely decorated place but doesn't want to do any of the decorating work themselves.\n- No pets :(\n-also in the complex, and available for use anytime: swimming pool, fitness center, sauna, and \"business center\" (i.e. the main office will fax/copy things for you)\n\n**About the Neighborhood**:\n- Pacifica Manor district, beachside\nWithin 2-3 blocks or less you can reach: Safeway, Walgreens, post office, gourmet deli, butchers, sushi, two pizza/ Italian restaurants, three taquerias, a non-Starbucks coffee hangout (plus two actual Starbucks), authentic English fish 'n chips, two bakeries (one that makes amazing bread and the other amazing desserts), a Chinese restaurant, two hot pot restaurants, Middle Eastern restaurant, chicken 'n waffle (cone) spot, soon to open ice cream parlor (Booza style!!), McDonalds, a gas station with honest mechanics, another gas station, 24 hour fitness gym, hot yoga, a place where you can learn to scuba dive and/or swim, and probably a ton more stuff that I'm forgetting. We have a walkability score of 74, which is pretty great for the 'burbs. Also lots of amazing hiking in the area and a spot to parasail within walking distance if you're into that!\n- The ocean is less than half a block from the apartment. The sound of surf will lull you to sleep. Really, this area is fantastic. And it's really close to the city...\n- 15-20 minutes door to door for most SF locations (without traffic). It takes less time to get from the mission to our place than from the Mission to outer sunset or the marina.\n\n**About Me (Your New Roommate)**:\nfemale, adult (mumbles age)\nnon-smoker/ drinker\n- neat/ clean/quiet/ contentious roommate - personality wise I'm outgoing and friendly\n- artsy and interesting, with a solid sense of humor. I like exploring, traveling, theater, improv, karaoke, painting, arting (it's a word!), hanging out with friends, and learning new things.\n- occasionally watches TV online (e.g. no cable); seem to attract friends that don't.\n- value kindness and consideration for other people, regardless of gender, race, orientation, etc. I *strongly* believe that the key to good roommate relations is respect, consideration, empathy, and good conflict resolution skills.\n\n**About You**:\n-roughly late 20's-40's\n-no smoking (including cannabis, though edibles=OK), heavy drinking, or heavy drugs\n-clean, kind, contentious, and quiet (no midnight bongo drum sessions).\n-considerate and respectful in all things, and just a generally Good Person\n-No couples :(. While the room itself is a good size, there is only one bathroom, and that can get crowded quickly with three full time people.\n\nCOVID STUFF:\nI'm fully vaccinated and mostly work from home. I'm also immunocompromised, so I mask in public and generally do my best to avoid COVID, because there's more chance it would be serious or lead to long COVID for me.\n\n**Fine Print**:\n-Utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, wifi, and household/cleaning supplies) generally run $100-120 each per month.\n-Willing to make a 1 year commitment.\n- Room is available now. Security deposit is $700.\n\nCool? Great. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more about me (your host, AJ) or the apartment, shoot me an email. To avoid spammers/ people who aren't reading this, please include your favorite ice cream flavor. Re: spammers - this has gotten much worse and it seems all want is my phone number. For this reason first contact will be via zoom, and we can call/ schedule in person visit from there.\n",

	"Hi there!\n\nI'm Jared, a 26-year-old male looking for a roommate around the same age (23-32) in the Walnut Creek, Concord, Pleasant Hill, Danville, Alamo, Martinez, Lafayette area. I have a full-time job and would prefer someone who also works full time.\n\nHere are some important details:\n\n•Pets: I don't own any pets myself, but I'm open to living with someone who does. Just make sure you're responsible for any pet-related expenses like deposits and rent.\n\n•Couples: I prefer not to live with couples to keep things simple. As a single person, I appreciate a straightforward living arrangement.\n\n•Music: I'm a guitarist, so there might be occasional sound or noise. If you're okay with that and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere, we'll get along just fine.\n\n•Hobbies: Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, collecting vinyl records, travel, and recently getting into skateboarding. It would be great to find someone who shares similar interests!\n\n•Budget: My budget range for my portion of the rent is $800-$1000 per month, plus utilities. Ideally, I'm looking for a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment.\n\n\nIf you're a responsible and friendly individual who's looking for a great roommate in this area, please reach out to me. Let's chat, get to know each other, and see if we'd be a good fit!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nJared\n    ",

	"Hi! I am a 37 y/o cishet white woman originally from Seattle, WA, I have lived in the Bay Area for 17 years. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice, and a minor in Art.  I am passionate about environmental justice, food sovereignty, and the intersection of art and activism. I am committed to doing my part in the fight for liberation and dismantling systems of oppression. I currently work full-time at a grocery store in San Francisco. Some of my interests include making art (such as drawing, painting, and screen printing), music, tarot reading, horror movies, cooking vegetarian & vegan food (I am vegetarian but am okay with meat being cooked around me), taking care of my indoor plant babies, and I am enthusiastic about learning more about gardening and growing food. \n\nI would love to find a home that feels safe, solid, and cozy. I have had many years of experience living in shared houses. I am very mindful, accepting, and respectful of all identities. I care greatly about creating a home where everyone feels safe and accepted. I value open, honest, trauma-informed communication. I am always open to talk about any conflict or issue that may arise, even when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. I am very conscious of how I impact and live in shared spaces. I am dedicated to reflecting on my own privilege, and I am continually learning how to be a better accomplice against oppression. \n\nI am very kind, empathetic, and supportive. I am an introvert who loves human connection and also needs a good amount of alone time to recharge. I enjoy spending time with my roommates and creating community in the house and am also considerate of my roommates' own space and time and respect their boundaries. I am respectful of the common spaces in the house and am good at keeping these clean. I am also not a neat-freak and understand if there is a little mess, as life and busy schedules can sometimes get in the way. I occasionally have a friend or two over, and have a couple drinks now and then, but I don't bring the party home. I am also 420-friendly. I do not have any pets of my own, but I love animals and am comfortable living in a household with fur babies. \n\nI am looking for a private, unfurnished room in the San Francisco Bay Area (preferably SF, Daly City, Oakland, or Berkeley) with women or nonbinary roommates. My budget is around $1300/month. My preferred move-in date is end of July. \n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your household, I would love to hear from you! Take care and best of luck in your housemate search!\n\nBest,\nM\n",

	"Hello, my name is Kevin. I am 46 years old and I am looking for a room, mobile home or studio to rent in the Santa Cruz area. I am very quiet, considerate and keep to myself. I would prefer an older roommate or roommates who are as mature and considerate as I am. Perhaps a single home owner that has a room available because of divorce or empty nest. The only thing I truly wish is to have the possible future option of getting 1 Teacup Chihuahua. No drugs, no drinks, no smoking. I am way over the partying years. I just want somewhere I can come home and be at peace. I lead a simple life and have very little material possessions or baggage. I have held the same job for the past 12 years and I also drive for Door Dash to get ahead, so money saved. No problem signing a year lease if it is a good fit. My monthly rent budget is no more than $1,200 based on my annual income. I'm pretty much alone in the world, so sharing housing is my only option even though I make what would be considered adequate in most cities. Cheap ol' Santa Cruz.\nContact me if you think that I might be the perfect fit for you. Thank you.\n",

	"The Inner Sunset… You know it, you love it. It’s got tons of great restaurants and shops, it’s right next to Golden Gate Park, right down the hill from UCSF, and the weather is a perfect mix of sunny and overcast. We have a room open in our three-bedroom, 1.5 bath apartment, with a great living room, a full kitchen, and a beautiful sunny (when sunny) garden out back. The N Judah stops on our corner. Our apartment is great, and we’re looking to complete it with someone who will mesh well with us and our lifestyles.\n\nThere are two of us living here currently. We’re two dudes in our early forties who have been friends for many years. One of us is a teacher, and the other is a stagehand, so we can have wildly different schedules, but still manage to sometimes cook together and hang out around the house. It’s a pretty social environment. We have a bunch of cool friends who visit us occasionally, and sometimes we’ll have a movie night or a small party. We’re 420-friendly and half queer, and are looking for a housemate who naturally fits.\n\nYou should be chill, down to earth, and be on top of your shit financially and easy to live with. Ideally you have your own friends who will be friendly and compatible with ours. We pitch in on chores together, and don’t really have a schedule or a rotation. We drink occasionally, usually just a beer or glass of wine with dinner. You should be similar, and not drink to excess regularly. \n\nThe room is 10’x13’, with a small closet. Its windows open onto a sky well which gets indirect light and is perfect for a little window garden. The living room is cozy, with some comfy couches, a dry bar, dining area, 5.1 surround, a turntable, and cool lighting. We have central heating, robust wi-fi and Xfinity's fastest residential internet. We split Comcast and PG&E three ways, which usually comes out to about $100-$130 per person depending on the time of year. The kitchen is well stocked and full of all the gadgets, including a dishwasher. We have a washer and dryer in the unit, and a fire pit in the garden.  We love animals, (one of us is Team Cat, one of us loves both!) but cannot accommodate pets at this time.\n\nGet in touch if it seems like a good fit. Please tell us a bit about yourself, your schedule, hobbies, and what you’re like around the house.  Not including this in your email may result in no reply! \n\nWe’d like to meet people soon, but our schedules are kind of busy. We can meet people over the weekend, or evenings during the week. Please let us know when would work for you. We look forward to meeting you!\n\n\n",

	"Hi, \n\nMy name is Nick and I am looking for a short term 3-6 month renter for a furnished bedroom with private bathroom and walk-in closet near the Oakland Airport.\nThe Bedroom has a queen sized bed, and a desk + chair. The private bathroom is only accessible from the bedroom and has two sinks and a shower, the walk-in closet is attached. \nThe property has a washer dryer, backyard, and an off-street parking spot. I may consider a quiet, hypoallergenic dog for an additional fee (I have allergies). \nYou would be splitting a 3 bedroom 2 bath single family home with just me. I am in my mid-thirties, work in tech, and work from home 2 days a week. I enjoy working out at the gym, playing video games, watching K-Dramas, and when I am home I am fairly quiet and tidy. \n\nI’m asking 1600 per month + Utilities (including internet) are about 150 a month per person. \nDeposit is 1600\n    ",
	"Hi,\n\n1 Roommate = $800 per month \n\nI am a Vegan 30-year old male, looking for 1 roommate to rent a shared kitchen, 3 private bedrooms, and private master bathroom. I am quiet, courteous, and respectful. Washer and dryer on site. The view is absolutely gorgeous. I do construction and will need 100% access to garage, except for the location of laundry machines. I will also need 100% access to the driveway for accessing garage. Though, there is plenty of parking on street! I do not cook (I have a mini refrigerator in my room and I eat a lot of raw salad). I exercise a lot and, therefore, am not home that much.\n\nUtilities (Water/Trash/Gas/Electricity) will be evenly divided 5/6 ways amongst 5/6 occupants. The landlord, his wife and son live downstairs, but they do not have access to the main part of the house -- they have a private entrance around the (outside) side of house -- I practically never see them.\n\nComcast will be evenly divided between 2 or 3 people\n",

My most recent roommate said he hardly noticed him.  \n\nI myself spend most of my time running a business in the South Bay. I'm mostly work from home these days, but at least one weekend day, I'm out all day. \n\nIn what spare time I have, I practice tai chi, meditate, and read poetry and philosophy. Lean Buddhist or Daoist. Not a vegetarian, though. (Also, I don't drink at all, so your liquor supply is safe from me. :) )\n\n",

We're located near the intersection of Ortega and 29th Ave. \n\nAmenities include (but aren't limited to):\n-Washer and dryer in the garage\n-Large kitchen\n-Spacious living room we've converted into a yoga/workout space\n-Tons of light(skylights/windows, everywhere)\n-Easy street parking\n\nThe house is conveniently located near restaurants and bars.

Our ideal roommate has a life outside of the house and has interests and goals that they pursue.  \n\nWe don't currently have a chore system and do not have time to create or manage one.

	"Hi, we have a room available at our place in the Dogpatch. The room is large, sunny, and has sliding doors to our deck. The bathroom is shared, but with only one roomate. \n\nThe aparment has three bedrooms, two full baths, and is on the top floor with a full private deck. The living room and kitchen are furnished, but we also have some room for you to add things if you'd like. We are litterally two blocks from the 22nd St. Caltrain station, one block from the Muni, and four blocks from the I-280 ramp. \n\nWe're looking for a clean and respectful roommate, with similar schedules. We're two professionals in our late 30's. A European tech sociologist & cook extraordinaire, and a genome biologist & ocean lover (surfing, free diving, kiting). We like grabbing a drink or a bite once in a while, but also have pretty tight schedules, so we really like to keep things relaxed and pretty low key at home during the week. \n\nThe neighborhood, the Dogpatch, it's amazing. Almost always sunny and 10 degrees warmer than the rest of SF. Workshops, brunch, galleries, gourmet ice cream, breweries, amazing restaurants, rock climbing, and literally less than 10 minutes from the 22nd St. Caltrain Station, Muni, and I-280 access. It is also in a flat part of town so it's also perfect for biking to a lot of places.\n\nThe rent for the room is $1,650 per month + 1/3 utilities. The sublet is month to month, with 45 days notice, and a 2 month deposit. Ideally we are looking for someone that is aiming to stay for the longer term, eg more than six months, but we may consider shorter terms. \n\nTo come see it, please tell us a little bit about yourself and what you are doing in SF. If you can share a linkedin or social profile to help show you are a working human able to pay rent, that would really help. We'll then get back to you and figure out a time for you to come see it. Cheers!\n    ",

	"Hi there, my name is Moe and I'm subletting my room for about a year, from Oct 1 2023 to July 1st, 2024.\n\nOriginal rent is $1133/mo, discounted rate is $1000/mo for the care of my cat, Panna Cotta!\n\nAbout the house: We are 3 white queers (K and A are my roommates), two of us are trans, including me! We're in the upper unit of a duplex on a side street thats relatively quiet with easy street parking. We have a huge private backyard with 3 garden beds that's perfect for gardening, parties, and laying about in the hammock! In-unit w/d, dishwasher, garbage disposal. We have 1 parking space which you can snag if the other K and A haven't already. There are stairs up to the front door and down to the backyard. We're 420 friendly but no cigarettes. Sorry, no couples or more pets!\n\nMy cat: He's a large (over 18 lbs) long-hair Maine Coon (at least that's what I think, he was rescued and I never DNA tested him) named Panna Cotta! He's a very sweet boy that enjoys being in the same room as people, and it incredibly low maintenance. He doesn't have any medications, illnesses, etc that could potentially flare up. The most he needs is kinda pricey vet food since he got surgery on his bladder a few years ago. He will let you know when he wants cuddles, and when he wants you to stop. Doesn't knock things off shelves which is nice! Overall a very chill cat. His litter box is inside my room and due to the lack of floor space in the rest of the apartment, it cannot be moved elsewhere. I have a litter genie which is INCREDIBLE at keeping things smelling like nothing and a great tool to have.\n\nAbout the room: Fully Furnished! Full-sized bed with storage drawers underneath. Medium sized and bright! Includes a small closet, and the connected bathroom is shared jack-and-jill style with my roommate A. We both have similar standards when it comes to bathroom cleanliness and it is routinely cleaned and maintained by the both of us.\n\nWhat we're looking for: We want to keep this a queer home, and prioritize BIPOC folks! A and K would like to be a part of the process, since obviously they would be sharing the home with someone new, and in A's case the shared bathroom. We would like someone who enjoys to be socially engaged to an extent, because we like to host events at our home, including craft and game nights, as well as larger parties in the backyard. You don't have to be a mega extrovert of course, but because our home is a small hub for queer community, we would like someone to be open to participate somewhat in the planning of things! :) Just someone who is clean, friendly, and obviously a cat person and will take good care of my furbaby while I'll away getting my masters!\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!! Thank you so much!\n",

	"Hello, \n\nI am looking for a new living arrangement. I am interested in having a like-minded roommate or roommates. SF is preferred, but I am open to considering other locations. After searching CL for housing and not really finding the ideal situation, I have decided to post an ad on CL in the hopes of seeing what's out there. \n\nAbout me: I am an associate professor at San Francisco State University. I am 40 years old and have lived in the Bay Area for the past 7 years. Currently, I live near SFSU campus, where I have resided on and off for about 6 years now. I have a month-to-month lease, so I can move whenever.  I have no pets. In terms of my schedule, I am typically at work on campus 2-3 days/week during the semester. I like to get out of town and go on road trips on the weekends, but also explore all that the Bay Area has to offer. \n\nAnyway, I am putting the feelers out to see what type of opportunity presents itself for a new cool place to call home. \n\nBest wishes, \nIan\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/iandunham/\n\n",

I need this to be a quick turnaround so the quicker you can tour it and send in materials, the better! About the place... It's a 3 bedroom apartment on the 4th floor of a walk up building. I'd much prefer to just have 1 roommate and have us share the 3rd bedroom as a small office when we're working from home. If there's space, maybe throw a couch in there and have it be a guest bedroom. The bedrooms aren't the biggest so having the 3rd room as a bonus one would be great. No washer/dryer in the building but there's central air. I also loved the rooftop when I toured it. We (David and I) are looking for a great clean roommate, with a positive outlook on life, even during these craziest of times.\n",

While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways:  580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for.

	"I am a single mom living with my two sons (9 and 6) who are with me during the week and sometimes on the weekend (shared custody with their dad).  We are pretty active, sometimes rambunctious household during the day, and at night quiet and asleep.  The kids have very limited amount of screen time, so they are pretty active in the house.  We are all social and outgoing, and accustomed to living with a roommate.  Our current roommate has lived with us for about 3 years and is moving out to relocate out of state. I currently work primarily from home (remotely) and only go into the office occasionally.\n\nWe have both front and back yard, with fire pit.  the square footage of the house is 1350, I don't know the square footage of the room, but its sizeable.  \n\nParking is street parking only. no off street parking available, but 95% of the time there's spots available in front of the house.\n\nAll utilities (including wifi) are included with rent. \n\nwasher/dryer.\n\nMove in costs: first & last month, plus security deposit of $500\n\nThe room is available now, and can be pro rated depending on when you move in. No lease required, month to month is fine with me.  I've lived with two other roommates in the last 5 years.  One stayed for 2 years and the most recent one stayed for 3 years.  I've always just gone with an informal month to month arrangement. \n\nOpen to pets.\n\nlet me know if you have any questions!\n\nJennie\n",
	"Seeking a Great Roommate\n\nBig lovely room available in shared household on August 21st/22nd! \nI’m seeking someone who is a good communicator, willing to share in household chores, and likes a balance of doing our own thing and being friendly when we’re both around. \n\nThe place: \nThe apartment is a cozy, sweet 2-bedroom corner unit on the second floor (one flight of stairs to reach) in Duboce Triangle - one block from beautiful Duboce park. The available bedroom is large - 12 x 15, and has a bay window, some built-in shelving, and a good sized closet, located outside the room in the hallway. Bedroom is currently lightly furnished with a bed, lamp and nightstand, but if you want to bring your own furniture, I can empty the room. The apartment has a sunny, stocked kitchen and a cozy furnished living room. Kitchen has a gas stove, fridge, microwave, toaster, but alas, no dishwasher. The split bathroom has a tub for soaking. Laundry is located downstairs in the building and takes credit cards.\n\nAbout the Area:\nEvery time I tell someone I live in Duboce Triangle, they light up and say “I LOVE Duboce Triangle!!” It’s easy to love it here - quaint, peaceful tree-lined streets all around, and a beautiful nearby park to catch the abundant sunshine. Both the N Judah and the Church st MUNI station are short blocks away, and you can walk to the 16th st BART in 15 minutes. The Castro, the Mission, and the Lower Haight are all right here, and there are tons of cafes, restaurants, and bars nearby. It’s in the geographic center of the city, so you can get most places pretty quickly from here. If you have a car, you can get a parking permit for the area, and street parking is relatively easy - I usually find a spot fairly quickly, and rarely need to park more than a couple of blocks away.\n\nSome things to consider: \nApartment currently has no pets, but I’m open to a well-behaved, mostly quiet dog. (Sorry, no cats, I’m allergic). No smoking of any kind in the house (this is not a 420 friendly household per my allergies/sensitivities). The house is scent-free. Please no perfume, incense, scented candles. The space is only big enough for one additional person (sorry, no couples). There’s no TV in the living room. \n\nAbout the Rent and Move In costs:\n$1695/month includes utilities and internet. Move in costs will be the first month’s rent, plus a deposit equal to one month’s rent, for a total of $3,390. \nYour lease agreement will be month to month, one year minimum stay preferred. \n\nAbout me: \nI’m a woman, originally from the East Coast - responsible, friendly, direct, a good communicator, and easy to get along with. I lead a pretty busy life, but often like to just relax at home too. Working full time and also currently in school for a Master’s degree. I prefer a pretty quiet house, so I’m able to study/work from home.\n\nAbout my potential roommate:\n-Easygoing, responsible, fun, fairly chill/quiet lifestyle\n-Non-smoking, non-fragrance or incense using\n-Sober or light drinkers okay but no heavy drinkers, drug use/partiers\n-Prefers a clean/tidy household and able to do house chores and pay rent without being reminded\n-Preferably someone with minimal stuff (apartment is totally furnished and there’s not much in the way of storage space outside of the room/closet). There is space in the apartment for a bicycle, if you have one.\n\nIf you’re interested and think you might be a match, please do get in touch and tell me about yourself! \nThanks - and I look forward to hearing from you!!\n    ",

We range in age from a mature early 20’s, to a youthful early 50’s, men and women. We decided our preference is to have a few more people around to save money. It works well for us because we are all good, likable, agreeable and BUSY! We live with more gratitude than attitude. 🙏😌We are aware of much of the tension and chaos locally and in the world, but try to be positive and proactive and to leave the drama outside our door. Home is our sanctuary 😌🙏!\n\nWe have a very large 3 bedroom 2 bath on the second story. The space for rent is in the “dining” area of the kitchen. There’s a closet with a door that, when open, can close off the space for privacy.  There are also blackout curtains. We’ve had several roommates that have all enjoyed the space and stayed for several months to a few years. If you’re generally easy going and a fairly deep sleeper, you’ll probably like it just fine. It’s nothing fancy, just keeping things simple. There’s a fan, a little 32” tv w Xfinity and streaming capability from several apps. Little bookshelf and bedside light.  It’s furnished with a twin mattress but you’re welcome to bring your own twin or full if you prefer.\n\nIn our living room we are blessed and spoiled to have an EPIC 120” home theater with 5 channel surround sound (including a subwoofer for each channel! 🤪💥🤯)\nIt’s pretty fun just having a movie night.\n\nWe’re a short walk to the bay marina area and park. Great park. Golf course and driving range. Dog park nearby too. As is the San Leandro shooting range and Oakland Airport. \nKaiser hospital right up the street.\n\nOur area is usually pretty safe and sane. There’s lots of families and kids. \n\nParking is on the street\n\n4 nice, newer, app based washers and dryers on site\n\nBeautiful pool area\n\nBest weather!!! \n\nTwo minute walk to the bus to Bart 2.1 miles away \n\nLots of shops and businesses and restaurants nearby including Walmart, Home Depot and Costco, which includes Costco Gas- cheapest around\n",

	"Room rent is $1100, partial work exchange possible, plus shared utilities (currently about $125 per person all utilities included).  We're located in a quiet and safe area of Maxwell Park in Oakland, less than half a mile from Mills/NU.  Move-in requires first and last month rent, plus $1,100 security deposit. \n\nMy housemate is moving out and I’m looking to fill her room. I'm a responsible, mature female and I work as an environmental consultant.  \nI love animals, going out dancing, seeing live concerts/shows, and exploring mama nature. I'm the type of person that can find beauty in the little things, and I consider myself to be a free-spirited individual. I like to keep a clean home, the type of space where I can walk around barefoot, and just kickback and relax at the end of the day. I usually like to keep to myself, but I'm always down to talk or hang out if you want company. I scored as an \"ISFP\" on the personality score, if you're curious lol. I'm pretty chill overall, understanding, and easy to live with as long as we maintain boundaries and responsibilities. I work out of the home some of the week so I may not be around that much, and I often go out when I want to socialize. However, company is always welcome, and I don't mind overnight guests as long as you're respectful of the home, and mindful of my schedule. The other roommate is a cat, interested in sleep and meditation, food and play! I occasionally like to have my homies over for dinner, movie/game nights, and drinks. You're always welcome to join or invite friends.\n\nThe room itself is pleasant, currently furnished but can be fully or partially unfurnished.  12’ x 11’ not counting a small walk-in closet (4 ½’ x 3’ 10”). With 2 East-facing windows, it is well insulated (fiberglass and recycled jeans insulation in walls and ceiling), was updated with dimmable LED lighting, 2 USB ports for direct charging, new high efficiency baseboard heater, and is cable-ready.  To give you an idea, the bed shown in the pics is a full-size.\n\nThe house has hardwood floors throughout, new appliances, a deck, excellent natural light.  Lots of plants, room for yours as well. \nThe bathroom is super fun -- radiant floor heat, excellent light with solar-operated skylight (more interesting plants), instant and unlimited hot water (Groher) which flows to the backyard through grey water lines.\n\nRoom is available to a pleasant, mature individual, preferably female (civilized males considered, please see form), financially secure, open in their communication style and friendly with their housemate, respectful of common areas.\nMust like cats, and you can’t have a dog because my previously mentioned 9-year old tabby is terribly afraid of dogs. I don't mind small pets like reptiles or other small creatures, just let me know about them in advance.\n\nI go away a few months per year, and if you’re interested I can lower the rent to $700 per month if/when you take care of my cat when I’m not home. Not a deal breaker - if you’d rather not get involved with her care I can make other arrangements.\n\nSounds good? Would you like to introduce yourself?  Please fill out the attached form. \nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-CKTu3-5UT7XqjMizK4k1upLIjmSHcnc3WRWQIVnfVg/edit\nIf we think we may be a match, let’s do a quick Zoom and I can have you over.\n    ",

	"We have a private room available for the perfect female flatmate.\n\nThe room is pretty big (about 15'x13'), has a nicely-sized closet, and is very quiet. It's unfurnished, but the rest of the house is completely furnished. We have a backyard garden and on-site laundry, but no parking. But if you have a car, you'll be happy to learn there is always plenty of street parking in the area (honestly! it's weird).\n\nYour prospective flatmates are a married couple (hetero), who maintain two households. Mrs. Flatmate works in the East Bay and stays there M-Th, spending weekends SF. Mr. Flatmate stays in SF full time, holding down the fort. It may seem like an odd arrangement, but it works for us, and we've had housemates for many years, so this isn't a new experiment we're just trying out.\n\nWe also have a friendly cat in the house, so if you're allergic or just averse, it's not the right fit. In fact, you should probably be at least slightly positive on cats rather than neutral or \"willing to tolerate if they stay away from me\" (because she probably won't). No additional pets are allowed by lease with the property owner, so fellow pet parents are not an option.\n\nRent is a $1450/month, which includes all utilities, internet, and a housekeeper who comes every other week. We'll need one month's security deposit in addition to the first month's rent, so the move-in cost is $2900. There's no lease term, but we prefer someone who is looking for a long-term situation. Ours is a very stable home, with only a couple roommate changes over the past six or seven years. People tend to stick around (because it's affordable and a great place to live!), and that's our preference too. We're definitely looking for someone who wants a place to call home for a while rather than a person who just wants somewhere to crash for a few months.\n",
	"My husband and I (31f, 27m) are looking for a roommate in our Fulton home.  All utilities and internet are included in the rent.\n\nTHE ROOM\nThe bedroom has a private entrance and it’s own parking spot. It’s connected to our garage so you have your own separate area but are welcome in the house. You’ll have a bathroom that is mostly private but sometimes our guests use it. The bedroom is large (12x20ish) and has a door to our backyard as well. You are welcome to paint it or customize it how you wish. There’s plenty of parking for guests if you have any \n\nTHE HOUSE\nOur house is in the country on a busy road. It’s near the freeway and right on the cusp of Santa Rosa. We have 1/2 an acre with chickens, ducks, a garden, 2 dogs and a cat. We also have a really cool backyard bar that you can use. We have a kitchen with all the cooking tools and spices you would need, a washer and dryer, lots of freezer space, and a second fridge at our bar outside should you ever need extra room. We have a woodstove inside as well as a nice living room and dining room area. There’s plenty of storage space in our garage should you need. There’s AC in the house but not in the bedroom you’d be renting though I’m happy to install a unit when summer comes around. \n\nABOUT US \nMy husband and I own the house. We have had roommates for many years and they usually end up being some of our best friends. We are very easy to get along with and are respectful to live with. Last year we decided to renovate the bathroom which is why we are roommate free right now. 😁 I work Mon-Fri 8am-4:30p and my husband works Sun-Wed 6am-6pm. We both love to hike, play video games, watch tv, and hang out with friends. We are friendly and are happy with roommates who want to hang out or ones that prefer to keep to themselves. I am an outgoing, active person and my husband is more shy and quiet. We are a 420 friendly household though cigarettes are not allowed to be smoked in the house (but you’re welcome to go to the bar or anywhere outside)\n\nIDEAL ROOMMATE\nWe are happy living with people who want to hang out with us or with someone who prefers to keep to themselves.  Cats are okay to bring but no dogs please. If you like gardening I’m happy to give you a spot for plants. There’s no expectation you help with yard work or anything. We keep pretty clean and while sometimes we might make a mess it is always cleaned up by the next day at the latest. We would like the same with our potential roommate. I cook a lot so someone who was in the kitchen less would be great but I’m happy to share the space!\n",
	"Hello! I have a room for rent in a 3 story townhouse in Cotati right at the train station available right now!\n\nAbout the room: The room is located on the second floor and shares a bathroom with only one other roommate. This area of the house is sectioned off from the main living area so it stays very quiet unless you like to keep the door to your entryway open. the roommate you will be next to is a very nice young man.  He is a very quiet guy and keeps to himself.  The room is unfurnished and will have new carpet.\n\nAbout the house: The house is a 3 story townhouse with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. On the bottom floor is the 2 car garage (we use this for a pool table and game room) as well as a bedroom and bathroom. On the second floor is the kitchen, living room two bedrooms and a bathroom (this is where your room is). On the third floor is the master suite. The kitchen comes with all appliances and accessories you could possibly need and you will have your own separate cabinet for food storage. A new washer and fairly new dryer are located inside the house. The house stays pretty clean and is hardwood floor in all common areas and carpet in the bedrooms. The house is furnished tastefully except for the bedrooms which are unfurnished.\nThere is plenty of parking on the street and if you have an electric car you can charge at the train station. It is an easy walk to Oliver's, Starbucks and Energy Fitness (8 mins max) and a nice walk from SSU (25 mins for me to get to my classroom and I move very slowly).\n\nAbout the roommates:\nBOTTOM FLOOR- This room is taken by my younger brother (26). He works full time at home and stays in his room a majority of the time. He is very respectful and enjoys being on his own or hanging out with others. He has 2 cats who you would absolutely never even know lived in the house. \n\nMIDDLE FLOOR- The room is available on this level. This is the room with a shared bathroom with another tenant who is a young male (mid 20s).  He is very quiet and, like all the others, stays in his room most of the time.\n\nTOP FLOOR- This room is taken by a 27 year old male who is very sweet, quiet and is used to living with many other people.  He also has one cat (Spooky).  You will likely not see Spooky much, he likes to stay in his room.\n\nFor the most part everyone in the house keeps to themselves in their rooms but the living room is furnished and available for anyone to use.\n\nGas, water and garbage are included in rent (all utilities).\n\nPlease send me an email or text telling me about yourself! Ideally you would be someone in their 20's who doesn't have any animals though I am okay with cats. Male, female, other, and any sexual orientation is welcome in this household. We all get along very well and we hope you will too! We are a NON CIGARETTE smoking household though we are all definitely 420 friendly if you smoke only in your bedroom and ensure the house does not smell.\n",

	"A large apartment in the inner sunset. There are 2 bedrooms to choose from. The bigger one has a view of downtown and has the morning sun.  The other one is smaller and has the afternoon sun streaming in and rents for $1850\n\nThe apartment is furnished and both rooms have a bed. There is a laundry in the garage, sharing it with the bottom floor apartment. The common space is used by you and me. We share all the bills which include, PG & and the internet. If you have a car there is a possibility you can pay extra for the garage space.  We are one block south of the N-Judah making it easy to get downtown and to the ballpark or the Warriors stadium.  We are 3 blocks south of Golden Gate Park and close to 19th Ave if you need a quick getaway from the city.\n\nThere is a fireplace, but we don’t really use it. I will be getting new carpeting in the next several months which will be exciting (for me at least).  \n\nI am hoping to have someone who wants to be social, shares food, stories, ideas, and creativity. I prefer someone who is 30+ and is responsible. I will need to check your references and make sure you are financially able to pay rent and bills on time.\n\nI am enclosing a few pictures of your space, but my roommate of 7+ years will be moving out on August 1st to live with his fiancé, so the space is not empty at the moment.\n\nWe have become close, and it felt like a family setting, I would like to continue that feeling. I am retired so I do a bit of travel, thus you will have some time to yourself.\n",

The city outside is wild and crazy enough without bringing it back here so, we try to keep the place relaxed with relatively few visitors as to have a safe, friendly home base to relax in and/or get work done. If you are interested, please drop us a line telling a bit about yourself. Thanks for your time and good luck in your hunt for an apartment.\n",
	"Live-in Caregiver Wanted\n\nWe are looking for a Live-in Caregiver for our 84-year-old Grandma living in our wonderful loving west San Jose house (only one quick mile from HWY 85) in exchange for free rent (plus additional income opportunities).\n\nOur loving Grandma has always been very kind, but some dementia can be frustrating for everyone at times. She is also getting physically weaker due to not getting enough attention on \"weekday\" mornings to early afternoons. This is why she needs a live-in caregiver to help her more in the mornings and early afternoons. We have some part-time caregivers who come to help in such ways, but Grandma now needs more attention, frequency, and consistency. Currently, she can stand with a walker, but with poor balance, and when rested enough she can take a few steps with assistance plus the walker to prevent her from falling. She needs her wheelchair when her legs get too tired. To keep her as strong and mentally capable as possible, she needs some simple daily exercises to regain and maintain strength as much as possible.\n\nCARETAKER RESPONSIBILITIES:\n* Changing Grandma's clothes & diapers when needed, easy portable toilet usage, walking and doing easy/safe exercise every couple of hours, bathing in a walk-in jacuzzi bathtub at least once per week,\nand other basic caregiver needs.\n* Staying connected with Grandma by maintaining meaningful social connections with her to prevent mental health deterioration.\n* Monday-Friday (5 days weekly, most weekends off); 8am to 3pm (ideally but\nnegotiable).\n* Must be very reliable, optimistic, patient, experienced and/or\nteachable, safe, and cheerful!\n* Must love our pets too :)\n\nNote: her son takes care of her on weekends and evenings after work,\nso you have those times off if you have another job and/or other interests.\n\nIn exchange for your live-in caregiving services, we will give\nthe following compensation:\n\n* Monthly room rent waived/free.\n* Utilities waived/free.\n* Monthly salary/income included with the opportunity for more income\non weekends and evenings when needed).\n* Late afternoons and evenings off!\n* Almost all Saturdays and Sundays off!\n* Compatible pets welcome :)\n\nAs a tenant/roommate, you will have access to our laundry machines, kitchen, refrigerator, and more…\n\n30 days notice will be required to terminate services.\n\nGrandma is Christian and everyone living in our house observes the weekly rest/quiet time (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset).

	"Hi! Our roommate is moving to the South Bay for her new job, so we have a beautiful room available in our 3 story, 5 bedroom, 2.5 bath house located just inside the Presidio. Our house is a spacious historic Officer’s Home. The room has lots of natural light with large south-facing windows, with views of the forest/city/Bay.

A few nights per week, the TV might be on. We generally keep it relaxed in the house with occasional hangouts, patio fires and wine, and sporadic roommate workout sessions in the living room. During the weekends, we are out and about, enjoying the city and the rest of the west coast, and world.\n\nWe’re 3 men and 1 woman, with a mix of career and hobbies. A few things loved by people in the house: backpacking, skiing/snowboarding, the perfect coffee, car repair, board games, cooking, exercise, surfing, reading, plants, bird watching, cycling, strolling the Presidio with Tucker, donuts, jiu jitsu, quiet time, yoga, travel, fog and did we mention coffee? We think we’re a friendly and varied bunch 🙂\n\nWe’re look for: a friendly, responsible housemate, who is looking to stay at least 9 months. You’re up for occasional housemate hangs, perhaps a spontaneous Tahoe trip or wine around the fire, and you probably appreciate the outdoors.  We all have our own hobbies but like to hang together too.\n\nWe like to keep our house tidy—kitchen especially.

	"Greetings, \n\nOne spacious private room, fully furnished, with private balcony, shared bathroom with 1 individual. \n\nLittle info about us:\nWe are 2 working individuals in our 30s who have been living together for few years now, looking for a 3rd roommate around our age. While we mostly keep to ourselves due to our busy schedules, we have been maintaining good and healthy communication. One person is often away and doesn’t spend much time at home, so the place is pretty quiet.\n\nWe seek to find someone chill, yet responsible/reliable, and respectful, another working individual who cares about maintaining a peaceful environment at home. This is not a party house, but a place to rest after a long day at work. With that said, we are not having frequent visitors, loud music, etc, and expect the same from you. \n\nImportant to note and non negotiable's: you must have a habit to remove your shoes at the entrance (no walking around in shoes in the apartment), the place is pet free, smoke free, drug free, hence if this is a part of your life we are unlikely to match. Room is for one individual only, we can not accept kids, couples, or pets unfortunately.\n\nMust pay rent on time, and be mindful and responsible around the house (make sure the oven/stove are off after cooking, locking the door, basics pretty much), as well as clean up after yourself and maintain the place clean and neat, especially in the common areas.\n\nHouse rules are explained in the beginning, and sticking to them helps us promote healthy environment that is free of conflicts. While we all have our differences, we expect to address them in a respectful way in case they arise. \n\nLocation:\nBordering with Piedmont neighborhood, walking distance to Piedmont Ave, 1 exit away from Lake Merrit (1 mile walking to get to the lake). \nVery close to freeways: 580, 880, 24, good connections, no freeway noise.\nGrocery stores nearby: Sprouts (0.8 miles), Trader Joes (1.5 miles), Whole Foods (1 mile), Piedmont Grocery (0.3 miles), Safeway (0.6 miles).\nWalking distance to: USPS, UPS, Kaiser, Mac Arthur Bart (1 mile),19th St Bart (1.5 miles), Morcom Rose Garden (5min), restaurants on Piedmont Ave. \nAlso nearby: Grand Lake Theater, restaurants on Grand Ave, Fitness SF, 24 Hr Fitness. \nLaundry: in the building\nParking: street parking (no hourly limit or meters, just have to watch for street sweeping days)\n\nWhen replying to the ad, kindly include a brief description of yourself, habits, interests, as well as move in date you are looking for. Feel free to ask any questions you might have :)\n\n\nTo move in: 1st month rent + last month rent + $1100 security deposit.\nLooking for someone for a LONG TERM, minimum a year stay. \nRent is $1100 + utilities (generally around $50).\n\nThank you and looking forward to hearing from you :)\n",

The common area is furnished with a couch and TV but the room is not furnished.

	"We have a room in a 3BR/1Bath opening up August 1st in a North Oakland/ South Berkeley Duplex with 2 women and 1 small dog (very friendly, but means we cannot have any more animals). All genders and identities are welcome. We’re looking for a roommate that is communicative, considerate, down to participate in our weekly cleaning rotation, and who is as engaged in making our home a chill and enjoyable place to live as we are. \n\nWe are in the ground floor unit, the landlord lives upstairs in a separate unit, the backyard is the only shared space. We have a good relationship with the landlord and she is cool with us hanging out in the yard as much as we want. The neighborhood is mellow, fun, and convenient. We love living here. \n\n\n\n Details:\n\n\n- $865.00/month\n\n\n- $1730 deposit( know this is high but landlord has always been good about returning to everyone that moves out so you can expect to get it back unless you destroy something)\n\n\n- month-to-month lease\n\n\n- Unfurnished (~11’x12’) room with closet and windows along west wall\n\n\n- Full kitchen with full-size refrigerator, gas stove, dishwasher, and shared appliances.\n\n\n- Washer/dryer in unit\n\n\n- Shared bathroom\n\n\n- The shared backyard is mostly brick and garden, very sunny, full of flowers, and fairly private\n\n\n- Lots of room to hang out, loads of natural sunlight throughout the year\n\n\n- Small amount of shared storage in the kitchen and living room \n\n\n-Walking distance to Ashby Bart, Berkeley Bowl, Telegraph Wholefoods, multiple bus lines, coffee shops, restaurants, Starry Plough, etc. \n\n\n- Mostly quiet neighborhood\n\n\n-Decent street parking, no driveway or garage\n\n\n-Noise considerations: this is an old house and the walls are pretty thin. The available bedroom shares a wall with one of our bedrooms and the dining room and some sound travels between rooms and also from upstairs. We try to be mindful late at night/ early in the morning and hope you would do the same, but also a tolerance of a small amount of noise is necessary to be happy here. \n\n\n- Accessibility: There are 5 steps from street level to the front door, not wheelchair accessible. Not a scent free space(though we do use mostly low scent products and appreciate a housemate that does the same).\n\n\n-Landlord requires credit check and references as part of application\n\n\n\n\nWe are both in our 30's. One of us works in theater production and the other is a graduate student and massage therapist. We both have many crafty-type hobbies we work on in the common areas from time to time. We have lots of houseplants and more are always welcome :) One of us pole dances and there is a pole in the dining room(if you pole or want to learn you are welcome to use it!). We both enjoy cooking and using our house as a space to unwind and recharge. As housemates our vibe is friendly and considerate but we live independent lives and have our own things going on. We like to check in when having a group of people over, but are open and accepting of having partners and friends over a reasonable amount. We value open communication about any issues that come up. Both of our schedules vary a bit but the house is usually quiet by 10/11pm. The dog that lives here is loving, sweet, playful, and aggressively cuddly. It is ideal if whoever moves in is a dog type of person. She will greet you with excitement and shake you down for pets on a daily basis. \nOne of us has lived here for 8 years and the other for 3 and we are really interested in finding someone who is a good fit for the place and for us as house mates. \n\n\n\nIf you're interested please reach out and tell us about yourself and what you're looking for in a glusing situation, and ask any questions you might have.\n    ",

	"Roommate wanted for shared home in Petaluma:  Looking for 1 housemate to join a friendly shared (between 3 persons including you) 2200 sq foot/4 bedroom house in Petaluma, starting after July 9th,  2023.  Your room ($1250 per month): 144 sq foot, unfurnished, with 2 windows, western facing so lots of light. You share a bathroom with 1 other (amazing:) female identifying person.  The interior common areas are mostly furnished (but if you have items of your own, we can discuss how to include:) and consist of a “great” room (living, dining, kitchen area with refrigerator) and a separate pantry with a second refrigerator, sink, washer,and dryer. We have lots of outdoor space and are just starting to develop the garden/landscaping so welcome anyone who likes to get their hands in the dirt and grow things:). There is a separate front yard with two chaise lounge chairs as well a main outdoor BBQ area with patio table & chairs flanked by another lounge area all located right off the great room/main entrance.  The house is located on a few acre farm so there is off-street parking within the gate that surrounds the entire property.  A very social (and cool) indoor/outdoor cat named Griff lives with us but tends to enter/exit and sleep in my room.  Unfortunately the landlord does not want any other pets at this time. On a day-to-day basis we all do our own things, and are independent, but we do have a communal consciousness to how we care for our home so we want someone who wants to live like that as well.  We care about finding the best ways to co-exist together and in general are pretty organic but still intentional about things.  We are positive, assume the best, consider others, communicate simply as we go along, and talk about things as needed so good “people” skills are valued and important to us.  There are a few other dwellings on the property and we have good relationships with the folks that live there. We tend to gather with them (and other friends who we each want to invite) for “family” style dinners here and there (every few weeks) and also host small house parties/outdoor gatherings a handful of times a year. Sometimes we have had group “game” or movie nights. No smoking indoors, nor cigarette butts in yard outdoors please. Must be 420 & (moderate consumption:) alcohol friendly. Would be ideal if you work outside the home, especially in the afternoons/evenings, in order to stagger all of our work schedules and optimize private time in common spaces as well.  That being said we sometimes cook, watch something, or hang out together as it feels right too.  Rent includes utilities (water, gas, trash, inet).  Also is $100 per person per month for electricity (an estimate based on past usage averaged over the entire year for heat) but if our bill exceeds that allotment due to high usage we contribute the difference split between us three ways. Month-to-month lease, but preference is for longer leases (if all is going well and everyone is happy) or if not we are open to you moving on to something that might work better for you. 1 month security deposit/30 days notice. DM me for a phone call to learn more and see if we might be a good fit for each other. Note:  I am currently traveling, but can show the space and meet starting July 8th:)\n",

	"Hi potential housemate *waves*! Thanks for stopping by to read my ad - if you like what you see don't hesitate to email to learn more.\n\n**About theApartment**:\n- 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment. The total rent is currently $2,405, and we split it evenly $1262.50 each. You get the bigger room and bigger closet with (partial) ocean view, and I get the assigned parking space. This is a great deal, since people moving into the same complex now pay over $3200/ month for the same size apartment we have. Why yes, I have lived here since the dawn of time; why do you ask?\n- Your room has a huge window facing west (the ocean! sunsets!), and one whole wall is a mirrored closet. So there's a *ton* of closet space, plus bathroom and kitchen space.\n- Apartment is fully furnished (except your room). This would be a great place for someone who wants to live in a nicely decorated place but doesn't want to do any of the decorating work themselves.\n- No pets :(\n-also in the complex, and available for use anytime: swimming pool, fitness center, sauna, and \"business center\" (i.e. the main office will fax/copy things for you)\n\n**About the Neighborhood**:\n- Pacifica Manor district, beachside\nWithin 2-3 blocks or less you can reach: Safeway, Walgreens, post office, gourmet deli, butchers, sushi, two pizza/ Italian restaurants, three taquerias, a non-Starbucks coffee hangout (plus two actual Starbucks), authentic English fish 'n chips, two bakeries (one that makes amazing bread and the other amazing desserts), a Chinese restaurant, two hot pot restaurants, Middle Eastern restaurant, chicken 'n waffle (cone) spot, soon to open ice cream parlor (Booza style!!), McDonalds, a gas station with honest mechanics, another gas station, 24 hour fitness gym, hot yoga, a place where you can learn to scuba dive and/or swim, and probably a ton more stuff that I'm forgetting. We have a walkability score of 74, which is pretty great for the 'burbs. Also lots of amazing hiking in the area and a spot to parasail within walking distance if you're into that!\n- The ocean is less than half a block from the apartment. The sound of surf will lull you to sleep. Really, this area is fantastic. And it's really close to the city...\n- 15-20 minutes door to door for most SF locations (without traffic). It takes less time to get from the mission to our place than from the Mission to outer sunset or the marina.\n\n**About Me (Your New Roommate)**:\nfemale, adult (mumbles age)\nnon-smoker/ drinker\n- neat/ clean/quiet/ contentious roommate - personality wise I'm outgoing and friendly\n- artsy and interesting, with a solid sense of humor. I like exploring, traveling, theater, improv, karaoke, painting, arting (it's a word!), hanging out with friends, and learning new things.\n- occasionally watches TV online (e.g. no cable); seem to attract friends that don't.\n- value kindness and consideration for other people, regardless of gender, race, orientation, etc. I *strongly* believe that the key to good roommate relations is respect, consideration, empathy, and good conflict resolution skills.\n\n**About You**:\n-roughly late 20's-40's\n-no smoking (including cannabis, though edibles=OK), heavy drinking, or heavy drugs\n-clean, kind, contentious, and quiet (no midnight bongo drum sessions).\n-considerate and respectful in all things, and just a generally Good Person\n-No couples :(. While the room itself is a good size, there is only one bathroom, and that can get crowded quickly with three full time people.\n\nCOVID STUFF:\nI'm fully vaccinated and mostly work from home. I'm also immunocompromised, so I mask in public and generally do my best to avoid COVID, because there's more chance it would be serious or lead to long COVID for me.\n\n**Fine Print**:\n-Utilities (water, sewer, gas, electric, wifi, and household/cleaning supplies) generally run $100-120 each per month.\n-Willing to make a 1 year commitment.\n- Room is available now. Security deposit is $700.\n\nCool? Great. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more about me (your host, AJ) or the apartment, shoot me an email. To avoid spammers/ people who aren't reading this, please include your favorite ice cream flavor. Re: spammers - this has gotten much worse and it seems all want is my phone number. For this reason first contact will be via zoom, and we can call/ schedule in person visit from there.\n",

	"Hello! My name is Jake. I am looking for a roommate to live in a nice community with. I would prefer to move in early August or late July, but I am flexible and can move in by the end of August. I was thinking North Park Apartments, Garden Grove Apartments, or Elan at River Oaks. I am open to other suggestions! Rent would be between $1500 and $2000 depending on the community and apartment complex that we choose. I am looking for a roommate because I'd rather room with someone friendly than have to pay around $3000 per month to live in one of these communities. I am open to male or female roommates. I have a super sweet pet cat. Must be friendly, good at communicating, and empathetic.\n\n\nAbout me: I recently graduated from USC with my masters in accounting. I will be moving up the south bay area (Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, or San Jose) for work. I like volleyball, hiking, camping, exploring new areas of town, and trying new things. Reach out to me if you are interested in being roomies and we can take it from there!\n    ",

During the week, you might not see her much until she emerges from her room to cook or grab some food from the kitchen. She's quite social but leans towards introversion. These days, she hits FitnessSF or F45 in the mornings or evenings.\n\nABOUT YOU:\nWe're looking for someone who's cool, clean (seriously, clean up after yourself), not awkward or weird, and social. We just want someone we can get along with and who won't be a dead weight. We want this place to feel like a home, not a college dorm.\nPrefer a guy because we'd like to have 2 guys 2 girls ideally.\n\nRENT AND UTILITIES:\n- Rent is $900/month, including garbage and water.\n- Utilities vary, ranging from $20-35/person in the summer and $30-70/person in the winter.\n- Xfinity Wi-Fi costs around $12.75/person.\n- Street parking is available; unfortunately, we don't have designated parking spots.\n- Move-in date is flexible, either at the end of July or the beginning of August.\n- You and I will share a bathroom, and remember, even the \"smaller rooms\" are about 13x15 square feet, which is considered spacious in San Francisco.\n\nLOCATION:\nCheck out Visitacion Valley!

	"Hi! I am a 37 y/o cishet white woman originally from Seattle, WA, I have lived in the Bay Area for 17 years. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Sustainability and Social Justice, and a minor in Art.  I am passionate about environmental justice, food sovereignty, and the intersection of art and activism. I am committed to doing my part in the fight for liberation and dismantling systems of oppression. I currently work full-time at a grocery store in San Francisco. Some of my interests include making art (such as drawing, painting, and screen printing), music, tarot reading, horror movies, cooking vegetarian & vegan food (I am vegetarian but am okay with meat being cooked around me), taking care of my indoor plant babies, and I am enthusiastic about learning more about gardening and growing food. \n\nI would love to find a home that feels safe, solid, and cozy. I have had many years of experience living in shared houses. I am very mindful, accepting, and respectful of all identities. I care greatly about creating a home where everyone feels safe and accepted. I value open, honest, trauma-informed communication. I am always open to talk about any conflict or issue that may arise, even when it’s difficult or uncomfortable. I am very conscious of how I impact and live in shared spaces. I am dedicated to reflecting on my own privilege, and I am continually learning how to be a better accomplice against oppression. \n\nI am very kind, empathetic, and supportive. I am an introvert who loves human connection and also needs a good amount of alone time to recharge. I enjoy spending time with my roommates and creating community in the house and am also considerate of my roommates' own space and time and respect their boundaries. I am respectful of the common spaces in the house and am good at keeping these clean. I am also not a neat-freak and understand if there is a little mess, as life and busy schedules can sometimes get in the way. I occasionally have a friend or two over, and have a couple drinks now and then, but I don't bring the party home. I am also 420-friendly. I do not have any pets of my own, but I love animals and am comfortable living in a household with fur babies. \n\nI am looking for a private, unfurnished room in the San Francisco Bay Area (preferably SF, Daly City, Oakland, or Berkeley) with women or nonbinary roommates. My budget is around $1300/month. My preferred move-in date is end of July. \n\nIf you think I would be a good fit for your household, I would love to hear from you! Take care and best of luck in your housemate search!\n\nBest,\nM\n",

	"Hello, my name is Kevin. I am 46 years old and I am looking for a room, mobile home or studio to rent in the Santa Cruz area. I am very quiet, considerate and keep to myself. I would prefer an older roommate or roommates who are as mature and considerate as I am. Perhaps a single home owner that has a room available because of divorce or empty nest. The only thing I truly wish is to have the possible future option of getting 1 Teacup Chihuahua. No drugs, no drinks, no smoking. I am way over the partying years. I just want somewhere I can come home and be at peace. I lead a simple life and have very little material possessions or baggage. I have held the same job for the past 12 years and I also drive for Door Dash to get ahead, so money saved. No problem signing a year lease if it is a good fit. My monthly rent budget is no more than $1,200 based on my annual income. I'm pretty much alone in the world, so sharing housing is my only option even though I make what would be considered adequate in most cities. Cheap ol' Santa Cruz.\nContact me if you think that I might be the perfect fit for you. Thank you.\n",

	"I was looking at an apartment with my friend, but she wants to look closer to her work in san mateo. I really like this apartment and am looking for a roommate to share it with! It's in a great location, close to SFSU, Stonestown and Pine Lake Park. There is 1 parking spot and tons of permit-free street parking, coin laundry, a shared backyard, dishwasher, and the only utilities we would need to pay are pg&e and internet.

I am looking for someone who can move in July 1. The landlord does need an answer by this weekend. \n\nAbout me: I am in my late 20s and work remote as a customer success manager in tech but may sometimes go into the office. I have a dog who will be living with us. He's about 7 years old and is extremely friendly. When we're not at home, we're usually in the outdoors or out with friends. I am also from the Bay Area originally and go home frequently. \n\nAbout you: self identifying-female, in your 20s, clean and responsible, with a work hard play hard mentality. Ideally would like someone to hang out with as well :) \n\nPlease reach out if you're interested and I will send more information :)\n    ",
